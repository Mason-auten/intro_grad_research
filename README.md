## üìå Overview

How can a poll of a few thousand respondents predict an election outcome? Why do some nations go to war while others reach peaceful settlements? Political scientists rely on quantitative methods to answer these questions and more.

This one-week math camp introduces incoming Ph.D. students to the core technical tools and professional norms of computational political science. You'll get hands-on experience with R, GitHub, and Quarto, and begin thinking critically about coding, workflow, and your time as a researcher in training.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of the week, students will:

- Build foundational fluency in **R**, especially for:
  - Data manipulation, transformation, and visualization
  - Script-based workflows for replication
- Learn and apply **technical tools** including:
  - Git and GitHub
  - Quarto and LaTeX for presentation and reproducibility
- Understand **professional expectations** of graduate school:
  - How to manage time, projects, and relationships
  - What‚Äôs expected of you in year 1 (and how to prepare)

## üí° Notes on AI Tools

ChatGPT and LLMs are powerful assistants‚Äîbut your brain is the main tool. Use LLMs to help troubleshoot or draft explanations, but do **not** outsource your reasoning. This camp is about building skills that LLMs can *enhance*, not replace.
