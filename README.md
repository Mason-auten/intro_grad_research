# Skills Camp: Intro to Quantitative Methods and Workflow for Political Science

**Vanderbilt University — Department of Political Science**\
**Instructors:** Mason Auten & Patrick Buhr\
**Dates:** August 18–22, 2025\
**Location:** Commons 349\
**Contact:** [mason.auten@vanderbilt.edu](mailto\:mason.auten@vanderbilt.edu), [patrick.buhr@vanderbilt.edu](mailto\:patrick.buhr@vanderbilt.edu)

## Overview

How can a poll of a few thousand respondents predict who will win an election with hundreds of millions of voters? Why do some nations go to war while others settle conflict without violence? How do race, gender, class, and age interact to shape an individual’s vote choice? Quantitative methods equip researchers with the statistical tools to answer these and other fundamental questions in political science.

In this one-week pre-course, students will gain a foundation in the tools and techniques of computational social science. Our goal is to set a foundation for students to begin work in the first two courses in the department’s statistics sequence: Brenton Kenkel’s *Mathematical Foundations of Political Analysis* and Nina McMurry’s *Statistics for Political Research I*. Our primary focus will be introducing and familiarizing students with **R**—a free and open-source programming language which has become the standard for computational social scientists. Our secondary focuses will be on technical tools for workflow and presentation, as well as professionalization in the graduate program.

## Learning Objectives

y the end of the week, students will:

1. Establish a foundation in R programming principles, with a focus on data manipulation, transformation, visualization, and basic description & inference.
2. Gain familiarity with common technical tools for workflow, data management, and presentation.
3. Develop an understanding of graduate‐level norms and expectations, including Vanderbilt‐specific requirements.


## Class Times and Office Hours

Our first session will be held **9:00 AM–12:00 PM** in Commons 349 and focuses on programming in R. The second session runs **1:00 PM–4:00 PM**, covering technical applications (GitHub, LaTeX, Quarto) or professionalization. **No sessions** on Wednesday, August 20 (ISSS & TA training).

## Computing

Political scientists have access to more data and computing power than ever before. The foundation of quantitative social science research is computer programming. This course will teach you to write clean, efficient code, with attention to the theoretical underpinnings of how your code manipulates data.

### Software

We will use **R**, an open‐source statistical language. Download **R** at [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org) and **RStudio** (the recommended IDE) at [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop) (RStudio is the most beginner‐friendly R IDE; feel free to use VS Code or Positron if preferred).

### ChatGPT and Generative AI

ChatGPT and other LLMs are tools—powerful ones, but not a substitute for your own analytical thinking. Use them for grammatical help or to troubleshoot code, but **do not** outsource your reasoning. LLMs can enhance your workflow, but your ability to think clearly about statistics sets you apart.
