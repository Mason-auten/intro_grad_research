# Crash Course on Prompting

- Think about how a LLM works. 
- It tries to predict the next word in the sentence. 
- We can think about it as a chain of conditional probabilities
  - $P(w_n| w_1, w_2, .... w_{n - 1})$
    - What is the probability that I should have word $w$ GIVEN proceeding words $w_{n-1}$. 

## Conditional Probabilities

- LLMs are just a sequence of probabilities, which can always be expressed like this

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n)= \\
P(w_1) \, P(w_2 \mid w_1) \, P(w_3 \mid w_1, w_2) \cdots P(w_n \mid w_1, \dots, w_{n-1})\\
= P(w_1) \prod_{k=2}^{n} P(w_k \mid w_1, \dots, w_{k-1})
\end{aligned}
$$

## Practical Advice

- We want to be specific when prompting Chat. 
- Instead of "fix this code"
- Try "I'm doing a data analysis project in political science. My dependent variable is war and my indepdent variable is economic activity. I want to graph the relationship between GDP and civil war occurence. Help me create a scatterplot that shows..."
