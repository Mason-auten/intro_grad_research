# Introduction and Roadmap

## Introduction

:::::: columns
::: column
-   In Political Science, people tend to use one of two programs:
    1.  LaTeX
    2.  Quarto
-   These tools are optional, but they will significantly improve your workflow and marketability.
-   Our advice: Pick one and learn it. Which one you pick is up to you.

**Why Can't I just Use Word?**

::: incremental
-   They are more flexible and can be automated more than programs like Word.
-   They are much easier to write math with.
-   They are a signaling device.
-   To quote one anonymous professor, "Academics are tiny, insignificant little people who will judge you for not having the accepted format of slides."

## Roadmap

1.  Quarto
2.  LaTex
3.  Math notation
4.  Bibliography Tools

# Quarto

## What is Quarto?

-   Quarto provides a way to combine code, results and prose all in one document [@wickham2019Advanced].

-   Quarto uses a markdown syntax. If you've used Rmarkdown or Obsidian, you're already familiar with this syntax.

    -   It's designed to be readable and easy to use.

-   You can use R, Python, Julia, and more types of code all in the same document.

-   You then render it to PDF, HTML, or a Word format.

-   You can make manuscripts, websites, presentations or more!

## Setting Up Quarto

-   If you're still traumatized from trying to set up Git, rest assured this process is much easier.

    1.  [Download Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
    2.  Choose your interface: RStudio, Positron, VS Code ect.

-   That's it!

## Basics

-   A Quarto file is a plain text file that ends in .qmd.
-   It is composed of three parts [@wickham2019Advanced]:
    1.  YAML: Which tells the document how to behave and look.
    2.  Code that you use throughout from LaTex to Python that is usable in the paper.
    3.  Text

## Example

```{r}
#| label: tbl-dv
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| tbl-cap: "Summary of Duration"
head(mtcars) |> knitr::kable()
```

````         
```r
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-dv
#| tbl-cap: "Summary of Duration"
#| fig-pos: "h"

missing_dv <- dat %>%
  select(duration_months) %>%
  miss_var_summary() 

## combine with summary data from skimr
dv_table <- dat %>%
  select(duration_months) %>%
  skim_without_charts() %>%
  select(skim_variable, numeric.mean, numeric.sd, numeric.p0, numeric.p50,numeric.p100) %>%
  left_join(missing_dv , by = c("skim_variable" = "variable")) %>%
  mutate(
    Variable = case_when(
      Variable == "duration_months" ~ "duration_months",
      TRUE ~ Variable
    )
  ) %>%
  select(Variable, `Missing %`, Mean, SD, Min, Median, Max)



# show table in output
dv_table%>%
  knitr::kable()
```
````

@tbl-dv shows the descriptive statistics of the dependent variable.

## Using Quarto

-   Papers are written pretty much as normal.
-   Here are a few simple codes you'll use:
    -   `#` for different heading levels
    -   `*word*` to italicize something.
    -   And insert a reference with `[@ref-key].`
    -   Use Markdown tables and forget that LaTex tables exist.

## Using Quarto Cont.

-   Insert code with Cmd + Option + I / Ctrl + Alt + I or type ```` ```{r} ``` ```` [@wickham2019Advanced].

-   When using code cells, there are multiple commands that you'll want to use

## Cheat Sheet

-   Here is a useful cheatsheet you might use

````         
```r
# Quarto chunk options â€” copy this chunk and edit.
# Lines starting with `#|` are options; trailing comments explain them.

#| label: demo-cheatsheet         # name for cross-refs (use @demo-cheatsheet)
#| echo: true                     # show code in the output
#| eval: false                    # don't run code 
#| warning: false                 # suppress R warnings
#| message: false                 # suppress error messages
#| error: true                    # allow errors without 
#| cache: true                    # reuse results if inputs unchanged (speed up)
#| output: true                  #  show slide output
#| fig-cap: "A figure caption"    # caption (enables figure numbering)
#| fig-width: 6                   # figure size in inches
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center              # left/center/right
#| out-width: "70%"               # scale displayed figure
#| tbl-cap: "A table caption"     # caption for tables (numbering + cross-refs)

# Example code 
plot(conflict_data)          

```
````

## Yaml

-   YAML just tells your document what it is supposed to be.

## Slides

-   You can make Beamer or revealjs slides in Quarto. These slides are revealjs.
-   Simply use `##` to make a new slide.
-   Use the code above to tell it what code you want to run and how.
-   Present

# LaTex

## Preamble

# Math Notation

# Bibliography Managment

## Clever Title

-   Remember, let the computer do the work!
