# Introduction and Roadmap

## Useful Resources
- These slides are designed for you to come back to if you need help with some commands. 
 - While not definitive, they should still be useful in the long run. 
- [[Cheat Sheet]{.button}](#sec-cheat)
- [[Notation Reference]{.button}](#sec-note)

## Introduction

:::::: columns
::: column
-   In Political Science, people tend to use one of two programs:
 1. LaTeX
 2. Quarto
-   These tools are optional, but they will significantly improve your workflow and marketability.
-   Our advice: Pick one and learn it. Which one you pick is up to you. However, you'll need to know a little of both for upcoming problem sets.

**Why Can't I Use Word?**

::: incremental
-   They are more flexible and can be automated more than programs like Word.
-   They are much easier to write math with.
-   They are a signaling device.
-   To quote one anonymous professor, "Academics are tiny, insignificant little people who will judge you for not having the accepted format of slides."

# Quarto

## What is Quarto?

-   Quarto provides a way to combine code, results, and prose all in one document [@wickham2019Advanced].

-   Quarto uses a Markdown syntax. If you've used Rmarkdown or Obsidian, you're already familiar with this syntax.

 -   It's designed to be readable and easy to use.

-   You can use R, Python, Julia, and more types of code all in the same document.

-   You then render it to PDF, HTML, or a Word format.

-   You can make manuscripts, websites, presentations, or more!

-   You're also going to have to use it for homework...

## Setting Up Quarto

-   If you're still traumatized from trying to set up Git, rest assured, this process is much easier.

 1. [Download Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
 2. Choose your interface: RStudio, Positron, VS Code, etc.

-   That's it!

## Basics

-   A Quarto file is a plain text file that ends in .qmd.
-   It is composed of three parts [@wickham2019Advanced]:
 1. YAML: Which tells the document how to behave and look.
 2. Code that you use throughout, from LaTeX to Python, that is usable in the paper.
 3. Text

## Example

```{r}
#| label: tbl-dv
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| tbl-cap: "Summary of Duration"
head(mtcars) |> knitr::kable()
```

````         
```r
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-dv
#| tbl-cap: "Summary of Duration"
#| fig-pos: "h"

missing_dv <- dat %>%
 select(duration_months) %>%
 miss_var_summary() 

## combine with summary data from skimr
dv_table <- dat %>%
 select(duration_months) %>%
 skim_without_charts() %>%
 select(skim_variable, numeric.mean, numeric.sd, numeric.p0, numeric.p50,numeric.p100) %>%
 left_join(missing_dv , by = c("skim_variable" = "variable")) %>%
 mutate(
 Variable = case_when(
 Variable == "duration_months" ~ "duration_months",
 TRUE ~ Variable
 )
 ) %>%
 select(Variable, `Missing %`, Mean, SD, Min, Median, Max)



# show table in output
dv_table%>%
 knitr::kable()
```
````

@tbl-dv shows the descriptive statistics of the dependent variable.

## Using Quarto

-   Papers are written as normal.
-   Here are a few simple codes you'll use:
 -   `#` for different heading levels
 -   `*word*` to italicize something.
 -   And insert a reference with `[@ref-key].`
 -   Use Markdown tables and forget that LaTeX tables exist.

## Using Quarto Cont.

-   Insert code with Cmd + Option + I / Ctrl + Alt + I or type ```` ```{r} ``` ```` [@wickham2019Advanced].

-   When using code cells, there are multiple commands that you'll want to use

## Cheat Sheet {#sec-cheat}

-   Here is a useful cheat sheet that should help you with some of those cell commands you'll need when making presentations for Stats I and Stats II.

::: {#tip-cheat .callout-tip title="Cheat Sheet"}
```         

# Lines starting with `#|` are options; trailing comments explain them.

#| label: demo-cheatsheet         # name for cross-refs
#| echo: true                     # show code in the output
#| eval: false                    # don't run code 
#| warning: false                 # suppress R warnings
#| message: false                 # suppress error messages
#| cache: true                    # reuse results if inputs unchanged (speed up)
#| output: true                  #  show slide output
#| fig-cap: "A figure caption"    # caption (enables figure numbering)
#| fig-width: 6                   # figure size in inches
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center              # left/center/right
#| out-width: "70%"               # scale displayed figure
#| tbl-cap: "A table caption"     # caption for tables (numbering + cross-refs)
```

## Yaml

-   YAML tells your document what it is supposed to be.

## Slides

-   You can make Beamer or revealjs slides in Quarto. These slides are reveal.js.
- Use `##` to make a new slide.
-   Use the code in @sec-cheat to tell it what code you want to run and how.
-   Present!

## Tips for Presenting Data in Quarto

-   Make sure output is readable and well-formatted.

-   For regression results, present a single table with columns per regression instead of multiple single-column tables.

-   Avoid printing the entire dataset in slides or problem sets. Print off a section of your results. Use:

    ``` r
    head(data)
    tail(data)
    dplyr::sample_n(data, size = 10)
    ```

# LaTeX

## Introduction

-   Quarto may feel like coding, but LaTeX is much closer to coding.
-   It uses a language to produce nice, stylized PDFs.
-   LaTeX has been around for a long time and is the standard in Political Science.
-   You have more control over your document and can create tables, figures, and reference pages that are much more customizable than Word.
-   Like Quarto, you can create slides, articles, or books with LaTeX. 
-   Most of what follows is a distilled version of [Nick Bednar's great introduction to LaTeX](https://nbednar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/latex_lesson.pdf). If you continue with LaTeX, I recommend you take a look at it.

## Editors

There are several different editors that use LaTeX.

-   Overleaf is the most popular and allows you to collaborate on documents together.
-   TeXworks is also fairly popular.
-   LyX has spell check and is more intuitive for some people.
-   VS Code has an extension that allows you to edit LaTeX documents in it.


## Preamble


- The preamble is everything before `\begin{document}` in a LaTeX file.
- It tells LaTeX how to format your document and which packages to load.
- Packages are add-ons that give LaTeX extra features (e.g., handling images, math, page layout, game trees, and so on).

## Example

```latex
\documentclass[12pt]{article} % Type of document, font size

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}   % Handle special characters
\usepackage{graphicx}         % Include images
\usepackage{amsmath}          % Better math formatting

\title{My First LaTeX Document}
\author{Your Name}
\date{\today}
\begin{document}
 % your content like 
\section{State Building and Conflict}
The most influential theory on the formation of the state is the bellicist theory 
\parencite{tilly1990}. 

\end{document}

```

## General Overview Continued

- LaTeX has many options and is highly customizable. There's too much to put into a few slides and teach you all of it. 
- Like Quarto, you can attach a .bib file and have LaTeX compile your reference page for you automatically. 
- You'll want to know some LaTeX commands regardless, as they are used for typing equations in both LaTeX and Quarto. 

# Math Notation

## Introduction

- Whether you use LaTeX or Quarto, they both use the same LaTeX math notation. 
- You'll need to know this notation for problem sets and specifying the equations you use in research papers. 
- In general, surround any math object with `$x$` to have it render correctly. 
- Use `$$x$$` to have the mathematical object show on its own line. 
- We can also wrap equations in specific LaTeX formats to have them display nicely. 


## Example: Code

```latex
$$
\begin{aligned}
A + B = C \\
A - C = B
\end{aligned}
$$
```

## Example: Rendered 

$$
\begin{aligned}
A + B = C \\
A - C = B
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example: Code
- Moving to more useful examples 

```latex
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[X] &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i p_i \\
\mathrm{Var}(X) &= E\big[(X - E[X])^2\big] \\
P(A \cap B) &= P(A) \cdot P(B) \\
\hat{\beta} &= (X^T X)^{-1} \cdot X^T Y
\end{aligned}
$$
```

## Example Display

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[X] &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i p_i \\
\mathrm{Var}(X) &= E\big[(X - E[X])^2\big] \\
P(A \cap B) &= P(A) \cdot P(B) \\
\hat{\beta} &= (X^T X)^{-1} \cdot X^T Y
\end{aligned}
$$

# Bibliography Management

## Principle 2: Let the Computer Do the Work -->

<!-- 
-  Why use software to manage your references? 
 -  Let the computer do the work! -->

## Takeaways

- You'll need a little of both LaTeX and Quarto for upcoming problem sets. 
 - Mason tends to use Quarto with LaTeX math and packages. 
 - Patrick and many others in the department use primarily LaTeX for its flexibility while using Quarto for slides or other uses. 
- The primary tool of use is up to you, but picking one and getting familiar with it will significantly help future you. 
- Regardless, learning LaTeX math will make typing equations much easier. 
- Consult the references folder on GitHub for templates of both types of documents.
