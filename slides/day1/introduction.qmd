## Who are you?

-   Name\
-   School\
-   What topics/problems in political science are you interested in?\
-   If you could have dinner with any political leader (broadly defined, dead or alive) who would it be and why?

## Why are you here?

You are interested in asking and answering questions about politics.

-   Why do some people turn out to vote at higher rates than others?\
-   Why do some countries go to war while other countries resolve their conflicts peacefully?\
-   Why is the military a trusted institution in some countries, but feared in others?\
-   Why are some Members of Congress effective at enacting their ideas into law, while others are not?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Quantitative methods can answer each of these questions.**

# What is Quantitative Methods?

## What is quantitative analysis?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Foundation of quantitative analysis:

-   Based on numerical measurements (i.e., what is the *quantity*?)\
-   Used to develop and test theories that are *generalizable*.\
-   Creates measurements and analyses that are *replicable*.\
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Quantitative analysis is one of three dominant paradigms in political science research; the other two are qualitative analysis and formal modeling.
-   No single method is inherently superior, but quantitative methods are currently dominant in political science and offer the best opportunities for academic and private sector employment.
:::
:::::

## Why use quantitative analysis?

-   **Description**: Summarizing and understanding the characteristics of the data we have.

-   **Inference**: Making generalizations about a population based on sample data.

-   **Prediction**: Forecasting future events or behaviors based on existing data patterns.

# Quantifying Concepts

## Operationalizing Concepts

-   For quantitative analysis, we need to **operationalize** a concept into a numerical representation.

-   Occasionally a variable will lend itself well to quantification: income, voter turnout, number of bills introduced by a Member of Congress, hours of cable television a person watches.

-   Other times, quantification is easy but there is dispute over which is the best measure: GDP, GDP per Capita, Human Development Index

## Example: Political Ideology

"Likert" scale, 7-point:\
1. Very Liberal\
2. Liberal\
3. Somewhat Liberal\
4. Moderate/Middle of the Road\
5. Somewhat Conservative\
6. Conservative\
7. Very Conservative

Measures both direction (Liberal vs. Conservative) as well as intensity (Somewhat vs. Very).

## Example: Racial Resentment

-   Can we use the same Likert scale?

-   On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being "strongly disagree" and 5 being "strong agree" how much do you agree with the following statements:

    -   "Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors."\
    -   "Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class."

-   Scores are averaged to create a composite racial resentment index.

## Why does operationalization matter?

# Variables

## Research Questions

Every quantitative paper in political science answers some variation of the following question:

> **How (or why) does** $x$ affect $y$?

-   $x$ is the "independent variable" which causes some change.\
-   $y$ is the "dependent variable" which is affected by (i.e. depends on) the change caused by $x$.

Every causal statement has the **counterfactual** of "if $x$ had been different, then $y$ would have been different too."

## What is a Variable?

We study **units**.

-   Units can be thought of as individuals.\
-   Examples of units: people, countries, congressional committees, states, cities, etc.

Units have **attributes**.

-   Characteristics of a unit that distinguish it from other units.

**Variables** are logical groupings of mutually exclusive attributes.

-   Each variable has a **score**—a numerical value corresponding to the attribute for that specific unit.\
-   Examples: GDP, Population, GDP per capita

## Dataframes

Dataframes are a structured way to organize variables.

::: fragment
-   **Rows** represent units (e.g., individuals, countries).\
:::

::: fragment
-   **Columns** represent variables (e.g., age, income, ideology).\
:::

::: fragment
-   **Cells** contain scores (the values of variables for each unit).
:::

::: fragment
In this course, we will only use dataframes. The major alternative to dataframes is lists, which are used primarily in engineering and computer science.
:::

## Levels of Measurement

-   **Categorical**: Data is in categories, but categories cannot be logically ordered (e.g. political party).\
-   **Ordinal**: Data is in categories, which can be logically ordered but without consistent intervals (e.g. level of education).\
-   **Continuous**: Numerical data with consistent intervals between values, and either a true zero point (ratio variables, e.g. height) no true zero point (interval variables, e.g. temperature).\
-   **Binary**: Data which can take one of two possible values (e.g. did or did not vote).

## Categorical Variables

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Definition**: 

Nominal variables classify data into distinct categories without any inherent order or ranking.

-   Categories are mutually exclusive.\
-   No logical order among categories.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Examples**: 

- **Political Party Affiliation**: Democrat, Republican, Independent, Other\
- **Country of Origin**: United States, Canada, Mexico\
- **Race**: Black, White, AAPI, Latino/a
:::
:::::

## Ordinal Variables

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Definition**: 

Ordinal variables have categories that can be ranked in a meaningful order, but the differences between categories are not necessarily equal.

-   Data has a clear ranking order.\
-   Differences between ranks are not necessarily equal.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Examples**:

-   **Political Ideology**: Very Liberal, Liberal, Moderate, Conservative, Very Conservative\
-   **Education Level**: No High School, High School, Some College, Bachelor’s Degree, Graduate Degree\
-   **Presidential Approval Ratings**: Strongly Approve, Approve, Neutral, Disapprove, Strongly Disapprove
:::
:::::

## Continuous Variables

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Definition**: 

Continuous (sometimes called numeric) variables have ordered categories with equal intervals between values.

-   Data is ordered with meaningful differences.\
-   Zero may or may not indicate an absence of the measured attribute.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Examples**:

-   **Temperature**: The difference between 40°F and 50°F is the same as between 50°F and 60°F.\
-   **SAT Scores**: The difference between 1100 and 1200 is the same as between 1200 and 1300.\
-   **Age:** The difference between 30 years old and 40 years old is the same as between 40 years old and 50 years old.
:::
:::::

## Binary Variables

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Definition**: 

Binary (sometimes called Boolean) variables are either 1 or 0 (or TRUE/FALSE)

-   Some variables are binary by definition.\
-   Often, we binarize a variable for analytic convenience.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Examples**:

-   **Voter turnout**: Either a person voted (1) or did not vote (0)\
-   **Party**: transform categorical into either a person is a Democrat (1) or not (0) which includes all others.\
-   **Income:** transform continuous into either a person makes ≥ \$100,000 (1) or not (0).
:::
:::::

## Examples

What type of variable is the following (categorical, ordinal, continuous, binary):

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Religious affiliation** (e.g. Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, None).\
Categorical, because categories are not ranked.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Unemployment rate in a Member of Congress's district** (percentage of constituents who are unemployed)\
Continuous, because distance between numbers is consistent.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**Political interest** (e.g. not interested, slightly interested, fairly interested, very interested)\
Ordinal, because categories have a ranking
:::

## Variable Choices

Often, we can represent concepts in different ways.

What would be the best way to operationalize education?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   **Categorical:** No High School, High School, Some College, Bachelor’s Degree, Graduate Degree.\
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   **Continuous:** Years of education.\
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   **Binary:** Whether or not an individual attended college.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   Best choice is based on your theory and research design.

# 10 Minute Break

# Programming

## Why Use R for Statistics?

-   R is a powerful and widely used programming language for statistical analysis.

-   It is free, open-source, and widely supported by researchers and data analysts.

-   R provides extensive libraries for data visualization, regression modeling, and machine learning.

-   Learning R enhances your ability to conduct independent research and analyze real-world data.

## Principles of Programming

**Principle One:** "Write code for humans."

-   Indent your code according to style conventions in www.style.tidyverse.org. RStudio will typically do this automatically.\
-   Add explanatory comments to everything you do using `#`.\
-   Basic principle: if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, could people figure out what I was trying to do and finish my code?

## Principles of Programming

**Principle Two:** "Let the computer do the work"

-   Copy-and-paste doesn't work: prone to errors, time intensive if you need to make changes, and confusing to read.\
-   Any repetitive task can be done with minimal lines of code.\
-   If someone else has your data and code, they must be able to replicate your same results.

## Debugging and Asking for Help

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Types of problems:

-   Errors: the R script stops because it cannot execute your command.\
-   Warnings: the R script was able to execute your command (and produce output) but thinks you need to check the output.\
-   Unexpected output: your script executed without warnings, but the output isn't what you expected (e.g. output is NA).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Solving problems:

1.  Find the exact line of code causing the problem.\
2.  Look on StackOverflow/ChatGPT.\
3.  Come to us in office hours.
:::

## Statement on ChatGPT

-   ChatGPT and other LLMs are **tools**. Being able to use them well will be an essential part of your workflow in the future.
-   However, like any tool, it is exceptionally easy to misuse ChatGPT if you don't know what you are doing.
-   Use ChatGPT for learning, to clarify concepts, and to troubleshoot your own code—but do **not** use it to replace your own analytical thinking.
-   Your ability to think clearly and rigorously about the underlying statistics is what will set you apart.
