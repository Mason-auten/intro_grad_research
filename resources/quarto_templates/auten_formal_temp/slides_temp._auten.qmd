## Introduction

> "Be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels." [@shakespeare2016KingHenryIV, 3109-3110]

## Overview

-   Throughout much of early history, bargaining occurred both with the elites with whom the budding central authority shared power and with external rulers.
-   Domestic elites contributed independently to the strength of the state.
-   How did shifting power among domestic parties influence war, peace, and the development of the state?

## Preview: Main Results

1.  Internal conflict, external conflict, and peace occur in equilibrium.
2.  Large domestic power shifts favoring the domestic elite (a contract mechanism) can cause war in the first round if the ruler values the future sufficiently.
3.  If the ruler does not value the future, then such power shifts result in external conflict in the second round.
4.  The ruler uses the threat of foreign war to extract more from domestic elites.
5.  In this way, contract mechanisms of state building can trigger bellecist mechanisms of state-building.

## Justification

-   Canonical theories of state building:
    1.  War-making [@tilly1985WarMakingState; @tilly1990CoercionCapitalEuropean; @queralt2019WarInternationalFinance].
    2.  Internal bargaining and contracts [@garfias2024StateBuildingHistoricalPolitical; @grzymala-busse2020WarContractsMedieval; @kenkel2023TheoryExternalWars; @levi1988RuleRevenue].
-   These theories each seem to capture only part of the story.

## Departure

-   Extending existing theories through multi-issue bargaining.
-   Considering two distinct sources of shifting power.
    -   One shifting exogenously.
    -   One shifting endogenously.

# Basline Model

## Baseline Model Approach

-   Bargaining occurs over two periods under complete information.
-   There is a domestic good, and a foreign good.
-   The elite cares only about the domestic good, the foreign opponent cares only about the foreign good, and the ruler cares about both.
-   Power shifts exogenously to favor the domestic elite over time.
    -   $p < p'$
-   Power shifts occur endogenously based on the bargain between the ruler and the elite regarding foreign opposition.
    -   $q > q'$

## Substance and Symbols

-   $\nu$: Domestic good (e.g., English wool trade).
    -   Conflict reduces its value: $\nu^c < \nu$.
-   $1$: Foreign good (e.g., English kingâ€™s holdings in Gascony).
    -   Divided via an external bargaining parameter: $q$.
    -   Conflict destroys $(1-\tau)\in(0,1)$ fraction of it.

## Players

-   $i \in \{R, E, F\}$
    -   $R \equiv$ Ruler
    -   $E \equiv$ Domestic elite
    -   $F \equiv$ Foreign adversary

## Actions

-   The ruler decides whether to fight with the foreign opponent $f \in \{0, 1\}$.
-   Before the outcome of that interaction is realized, $R$ makes an offer, $x$, to $E$.
-   $E$ accepts or rejects.
-   If $E$ defects, then $R$'s probability of defeating the foreign opponent decreases.

## Sequence

1.  $R$ decides whether to initiate conflict with $F$ or not.

2.  $R$ makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to $E$.

3.  $E$ accepts or rejects; rejection ends the game with domestic conflict.

4.  If $E$ accepts, the game moves on to round 2, and the interaction repeats.

5.  The game ends, and payoffs are received.

# Analysis

## War in the Second Round

-   Internal conflict never occurs in the second round.
-   External conflict occurs in the second round when:
    -   The value of the domestic good is not too high.
    -   Power is highly in favor of the elite.
-   The ruler uses the threat of external conflict to indirectly manipulate the reservation value of the elite.

## Round 1

-   External conflict can happen in round 1 IFF it does not occur in round 2.
-   Internal conflict can occurs when players are sufficiently patient and the domestic power shift is large.
-   Sometimes, the prospect of future external conflict in round 2 makes it easier to collapse the bargaining range in round 1.

## Comments

-   Domestic power shifts cause conflict more often now.
    -   Even if a peaceful domestic power shift happens, external conflict may occur in round 2 so that the ruler can extract more from the elite
-   The ruler may want to stop the power shift because:
    -   They do not want peace the elite will implement [@fearonRationalistExplanationsWar1995]
    -   However, the inefficiency of external war in the second round makes this outcome more likely because future war implies that some inefficiency will arise regardless; the ruler merely needs to decide *where* it is best to bear that cost

## Comments

-   The shift of power in relation to the foreign adversary leads to different equilibrium outcomes depending on other parameters.
    -   In general, a larger shift means greater chances of war in the second round.
    -   However, when the ruler becomes more patient, intermediate power shifts incentivize the ruler toward internal conflict.
    -   Future inefficiencies make it rational to stop the internal power shift.
    -   When the ruler does not need the elite, and their bargaining position relative to the foreign power is strong, peace prevails.

# Extension

## Set-up

-   Now, Foreign adversary ($F$) becomes strategic, choosing whether to influence domestic elites ($E$).
-   New possible outcomes include peace, foreign conflict (with $E$ aligned with $R$), allied conflict ($E$ and $F$ vs. $R$), or civil war.

## Changes

-   The foreign opponent decides to support the domestic elite or not $s \in \{0, 1\}$.
    -   Support is costly and functions as a deal between the elite and foreign power, conditional on them ruling.
        -   "Would you like some of Gascony?"
-   The ruler decides whether to fight with the foreign opponent $f \in \{0, 1\}$.
    -   Before the outcome of that interaction is realized, $R$ makes an offer, $x$, to $E$.

## Changes

-   $E$ accepts or rejects the offer from the ruler.
-   When rejecting, it is assumed that $E$ accepts $F's$ offer.
    -   Rejection now leads to $(1 - p)(\nu^c + \gamma)$
-   Ruler now needs to offer more to keep elite because bargaining is occasionally over both foreign and domestic goods.

## Sequence

1.  $F$ chooses to support $E$ or not
2.  $R$ decides whether to initiate conflict with $F$ or not.
3.  $R$ makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to $E$.
4.  $E$ accepts or rejects; rejection ends the game with domestic conflict.
5.  The game ends, and payoffs are received.

| $U_F$ | $1 - q'$ | $1 - q' - \gamma^c$ | $(1 - q')\tau$ | $(1 - q')(\tau - \gamma^c)$ |

## Tentative Results

-   $\gamma$ shifts how much rulers must offer elites, occasionally eliminating bargaining options entirely.
-   Anticipating  xternal conflict, $F$ sometimes invests in the elite to avoid direct conflict.
-   Such investments can trigger unique conflict scenarios:
    -   Ruler may attack elites directly because paying them off is too costly.
    -   Thus, foreign investment can prevent direct foreign conflict via incentivizing domestic conflict.

## Conclusion

-   Even successful domestic bargaining triggers incentives for future external conflicts
-   Perversely, the future inefficiency of war weighs on present decision-making and creates further avenues for domestic conflict.
-   Internal contracts between the elite and the ruler could spur external conflict.
-   Hence, state building through contracting may help trigger state building through war making. Equations

# Equations for Federica 

## Foreign War in Round 2

- $\nu <\frac{(1 - p)\nu^c(1 - q) - q' (1 - \tau)}{1 - q'}$

## Internal War Conditions

- $\delta > \frac{1 - p'}{1 - p}$
- If there is peace in round 2
  - Then war when: $\delta > \frac{\nu + q' - p'(\nu^c + q)}{\nu^c (1 - p)}$ 
- If there is war in round 2,
  - Then internal war in round 1 when: $\delta > \frac{q'[\nu - p'(\nu^c + q)]}{q(1 - p)\nu^c}$

## Extension: Foreign Funded Conflict
- If $s = 1$, and the following hold, then $R$ prefers internal conflict
  - $\nu - \nu^c + q' - pq \leq \gamma$
  - $\nu \geq \dfrac{\gamma - \tau(q' - \underline{p}) + \nu^c}{q'}$
- And $F$ prefers to invest 
  - $1 - \gamma + p(\gamma - \gamma^c) - pq > (1 - q')\tau$
