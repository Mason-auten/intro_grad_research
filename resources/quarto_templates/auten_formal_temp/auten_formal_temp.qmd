  \noindent \singlespacing During wartime, political leaders rely on the military to fight and relay information. This principal-agent relationship creates issues for communication as the military may have preferences that differ from those of the politician. How do these dynamics influence honest communication and war duration? I present a formal model that models an exogenous shock in power during a war. The military witnesses this shock, but the politician does not. While an equilibrium always exists where the politician ignores the military, I show how there are scenarios where communication can influence political decision-making and, thus, war duration. I show how incentives for honest communication are unlikely at the start of the conflict but become more likely as the war goes on.

# Introduction

Any information a political leader obtains in war is often heard secondhand from others. The degree to which a political leader can trust the Military may impact how much the leader learns from war and, ultimately, how long war lasts. Under what conditions can the asymmetric information between the Military and the Politician impact war duration and what incentivizes honest communication? I argue that because the Military has its own set of preferences over outcomes, often the Military will be ignored by the Politician in equilibrium. I provide a model in which the Military communicates with the Politician during a war. In the model, the Military has private information about the strength of the enemy and can recommend withdrawing or escalating. Honest and credible communication is possible in the model but only under tight constraints on the parameters. Honest communication is more likely to arise later in the war than earlier. The relationship between honest communication and war duration is non-monotonic. The Politician always does at least as well in an equilibrium with honest communication as in an equilibrium without honest communication. Under some conditions, the Military can send credible information and is more likely to be able to do so after the war has progressed.

The central tension that makes the Politicians and the Military unable to communicate successfully is the transfer of resources that escalating a war entails or the costs the Military endures. Even though war is costly, the Military receives transfers of resources in terms of funding and equipment, and escalating war to increase the probability of victory entails sending more funding to the Military.

This paper proceeds as follows: First, I provide a literature review examining war duration and asymmetric information. I then introduce how my model fits into this literature. Next, I provide my model setup and discuss the results. Then, I provide a discussion tying some of the results to substantive implications.

## Literature Review

If war starts due to asymmetric information and incentives to misrepresent, then when does war end [@fearonRationalistExplanationsWar1995; @wagnerBargainingWar2000]? Most papers examining asymmetric information propose some version of the principle of convergence, which states that "war ceases to be useful when it loses its information content" [@slantchevPrincipleConvergenceWartime2003, p. 627]. In other words, when uncertainty about types prevails, actors utilize information from separate information channels to learn about the "type" of the enemy [@filsonBargainingFightingImpact2004; @powellBargainingLearningFighting2004]. Generally, bargaining is the manipulable source of information, and fighting is a noisy but non-manipulable source of information [@filsonBargainingFightingImpact2004; @powellBargainingLearningFighting2004; @slantchevPrincipleConvergenceWartime2003; @wagnerBargainingWar2000]. Once an actor has learned about the "type" of enemy through fighting and bargaining, a bargain can be struck that ends the war. However, two decisions change the results found in these papers. First, the decision as to what parameter the actors are uncertain [@powellBargainingLearningFighting2004]. Second, the sources of information available to the actors [@heifetzEscalationDelayProtracted2005].

The source of private information can be one of several things. Actors can be uncertain about costs or resolve[^1] [@slantchevPrincipleConvergenceWartime2003; @smithMilitarizedDisputesUncertainty2019], the amount of resources at a player's disposal [@baligaBargainingWarReview2019]; the desire of a particular play to conquer another [@spanielSlowLearnBargaining2016]; a player's reservation value [@heifetzEscalationDelayProtracted2005], the cost of concessions [@sanaeiTimeEssenceCausal2019; @yaredDynamicTheoryWar2010], or about the power of a player [@filsonBargainingModelWar2002; @filsonBargainingFightingImpact2004; @filsonDynamicsBargainingWar2007; @filsonSensitivityCostsFighting2007; @kraininRationalQuagmiresAttrition2020]. The choice of uncertainty is essential as it impacts the model's results. @powellBargainingLearningFighting2004 finds that peace is assured if uncertainty is about costs and players can make enough offers between fighting. However, if uncertainty is about power, the amount of offers made between fights does not generate more peace [@powellBargainingLearningFighting2004]. The crucial factor is whether asymmetric information impacts both player's payoffs or only one player's payoffs.

[^1]: To see why these can be lumped together, imagine that resolve reduces costs in the following fashion: $\frac{c_A}{R_A}$. This can be rewritten as $c_A$ [@spanielFormalModelsCrisis2024].

In most models of incomplete information previously listed, war tends to end shortly due to the principle of convergence. The short wars results have even been a suggested reason to prefer models that cover commitment problems since they seem to explain long wars [@powellPersistentFightingShifting2012]. However, several models capture long wars under asymmetric information by modifying assumptions of the costly process. @spanielSlowLearnBargaining2016 introduce a new type of asymmetric information by focusing on how states may be uncertain about how much the other side desires to conquer the other. Such asymmetric information creates strong incentives to misrepresent, and the "moderate" types consistently reject offers to pool with the extremist types, thus causing wars to last longer. This result is mainly because the actors' preferences are now about the outcome, and both types have the same probability of victory and cost. The proposer now updates their beliefs very slowly due to these incentives to misrepresent. Hence, simply by introducing a new concept, we recover longer-lasting wars. Alternatively, @smithBargainingNatureWar2004 find that war may last longer if the actors have different prior beliefs about who is likely to win. Ultimately, war is prolonged by the distance between the two priors and the time it takes for them to converge so that the actors can agree to a bargain or until one of the sides has captured enough territory [@smithBargainingNatureWar2004].

Similarly, @yaredDynamicTheoryWar2010 finds that when the learning of a player is conditional, wars can again last a long time. Conditional, in this sense, means that the side that extends the offer cannot be certain why concessions failed and, therefore, can not update their beliefs about the enemy. In such a scenario, wars may only end with the collapse of one of the players [@yaredDynamicTheoryWar2010]. Alternatively, one can drop the bargaining framework altogether and instead conceptualize ongoing conflict as a type of assurance game [@acemogluCyclesConflictEconomic2014]. @acemogluCyclesConflictEconomic2014 developed a model where the actors do not entirely remember the game's history and can misperceive the actions of the other. The uncertainty is thus over types and the imperfectly observed move. In such a scenario, war can break out and continue in a "cycle of violence" [@acemogluCyclesConflictEconomic2014, p. 1363]. However, rather than "beliefs converging," long wars lead to peace precisely because they cease to be informative, and the odds that a misperception occurred increase. Hence, instead of war being a learning process, it is a process of killing and forgetting. These works demonstrate that asymmetric information can result in more protracted wars under certain conditions and assumptions, contrary to @powellPersistentFightingShifting2012. A growing body of work examines empirical applications of uncertainty in conflict [@smithMilitarizedDisputesUncertainty2019; @wolfordTurnoverTrapNew2007; @wuLeadersStatesReputations2018]. For example, asymmetric information could be more prevalent when leaders are less known by the enemy [@smithMilitarizedDisputesUncertainty2019]. This work finds that longer leader tenure is associated with shorter wars [@smithMilitaryCoalitionsPolitics2021; @wuLeadersStatesReputations2018]. Other work postulates that military intervention in wartime [@shirkeyUncertaintyWarDuration2016] and variation in how informative battlefield events are [@weisigerLearningBattlefieldInformation2016] can explain empirical reasons for asymmetric information.

Some work links principal agent components to wartime [@downs1994ConflictAgencyGambling; @fey2010WhenShuttleDiplomacy]. In @downs1994ConflictAgencyGambling, the principal agent dynamic is between voters and the political leader. Under some circumstances, the leader has perverse incentives to go to war when they otherwise would not if they believe they are likely to be voted from office [@downs1994ConflictAgencyGambling]. On the other hand, the @fey2010WhenShuttleDiplomacy model most closely resembles mine. Here, an agent attempts diplomacy by providing information to two states in a crisis. In equilibrium, shuttle diplomacy only works when the third party has independent information.

However, few theories or empirical works examine how the principal-agent problem between the military and political decision-makers impacts war duration. One of the pathways that most models use for information updating, fighting, is done by the military apparatus. Moreover, the Military has intelligence and informs the politicians of the outcome of battlefield outcomes. The different preferences the Military may have and how such communications impact war duration have yet to be examined. My model aims to fill this gap by examining this relationship in the context of an ongoing war.

# Model Setup

This game has two players $i \in \{P, M \}$. $P$ represents the political decision-makers and $M$ represents the military. The strategic interaction with the enemy is assumed away to focus on the tension between $M$ and $P$. I assume that a conflict is already underway, and the game begins with an exogenous shock to the enemy's power. The timing of the game proceeds as follows: Nature chooses a state of the world $\omega_E$ such that the enemy the players are facing is either strong, $\omega_E = 1$, or weak $\omega_E = 0$. The state of the world is such that $\omega_E = 1$ with probability $p$ and $\omega_E = 0$ with probability $1 - p$. $M$ knows the true state of the world, but $P$ does not. $M$ chooses a signal to send to $P$, where they recommend either escalating the conflict or withdrawing[^2], $s_1 = \{e, w\}$. $P$ then updates their beliefs on what type they believe the enemy is and chooses whether to escalate or withdraw $a_1 = \{e, w\}$. Let the moves be indexed by the time period, $t$, and the payoffs be indexed by the player, $i$. In cases where the notation is common to both players and round, the subscript will be the player, and the superscript will represent the round number.

[^2]: If there were a signal to continue the war at present capacity, this action would always be dominated for $M$ by $e$. This means that $M$ would never play $c$ in any equilibrium. This is because escalation increases the probability of victory by funneling resources to the Military. Hence, $e$ always dominates continue, and $M$ would never play continue.

If $P$ withdraws, both players receive their reservation value for round $t$, $\lambda_{P}^t$ and $\lambda_{M}^t$. Let all probabilities be a function of the state of the world. The probability of winning against any specific type can be written generally as $m(\omega_E)$, the probability of a stalemate in round 1 is $r(\omega_E)$, and the probability of losing is $q(\omega_E)$. The probabilities are such that $1 = m(\omega_E) + q(\omega_E) + r(\omega_E)$. The probabilities vary based on the state of the world where $m(1)$ is the probability of victory when $\omega_E = 1$ and $m(0)$ is the probability of victory when $\omega_E = 0$. The probabilities are such that $m(1) > m(0)$ and $q(0) > q(1)$. While this does not need to be the case, I also assume that the probability of a stalemate is higher when facing the strong type. Hence, increasing the probability of victory decreases the probability of losing and obtaining a stalemate uniformly. Upon moving to round 2, I also assume that the probability mass of $r(\omega_E)$ is equally absorbed by $m(\omega_E)$ and $q(\omega_E)$ such that they start off each with an additional $.5 \cdot r(\omega_E)$. After nature decides the state of the world, $M$ sends a signal $s_1$. Upon receiving the signal the first time $P$ updates their belief, $\mu_1(s_1)$, from their prior belief, $\mu_0$. If $P$ plays $a_1 = e$, the winning probability increases. Throughout the analysis, I assume that in the first round, both $q(\omega_E)$ and $r(\omega_E)$ decrease given escalation and that they decrease equally[^3]. The escalation in the probability of victory in round 2 need not equal the escalation in round 1. Round 2 or round 1 may have experienced a higher change in probability than the other. Moreover, I do not assume that the probability of victory and the resources spent form a one-to-one relationship. The probability of victory may greatly increase or barely increase with investments. Hence, the parameter varies, and we can examine when such shifts in either parameter help sustain a particular type of equilibrium. After $P$ selects an action, $N$ selects the outcome where the players win, lose, or are in a stalemate. If a stalemate occurs, each receives a stage payoff and proceeds to the second round. Let this stage payoff be characterized as $x_i$.

[^3]: While this need not be the case, it helps keep the analysis tractable.

In round 2, $P$ updates their belief, $\mu_2(s_1, r)$, as to the state of the world based on a stalemate having occurred. Play then proceeds as before with $M$ sending a signal, $P$ updating their belief again, $\mu_2(r, s_2)$, and then choosing $e$ or $w$. Round 2 is the final round, and a stalemate is impossible. Again, escalating takes resources but increases the probability of winning to $m(\omega_E)'$ and decreases the probability of losing to $q(\omega_E)$. The probabilities again must sum to one. The relationship to first-round probabilities is as follows: $m(\omega_E)' > m(\omega_E)$.

$P$ has four total beliefs in this game. All beliefs are updated with Bayes rule where possible, and the solution set for this game is Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBE). The prior belief, $\mu_0$, is defined based on the prior probability of the enemy being weak. The full mathematical definition of all beliefs can be found at @tbl-symbols. $\mu_1(s_1)$ is the updated belief after $M$ sends the first signal. $\mu_2(s_1, r)$ is the updated belief in the second round based on both players having made it to round 2. $\mu_2(r, s_2)$ is the final belief and is defined as the belief that $P$ is facing the weak type given both of $M$'s signals and the stalemate. Each player's payoff in the second round is a function of the beliefs of $P$. This payoff can vary based on the strategic behavior that influences $P$'s belief in the subsequent round. I will refer to the continuation payoffs when the state of the world is such that the players are facing the weak type as $V_i(\mu_2)'$ and $V_i(\mu_2)$ for the strong type. Each payoff will also be discounted by a common discount factor, $\delta$.

The strategic tension of the game is captured by $P$ and $M$, which do not always share an overlapping interest over outcomes. $P$ wants to win at the least cost possible. Escalation increases the probability of winning, but $P$ also suffers from a decrease in resources each round. As such, round 2's amount of resources available to $P$ is less than they were in round 1, and I assume that losing means $P$ gets fewer resources than when they win. $M$ has its own preferences over outcomes that need not always be aligned with $P$'s preferences. $M's$ utility is increasing with each escalation. Escalation entails more resources transferred to the military apparatus, so $M$ may benefit from war even though they pay a cost. While $M$ suffers a more direct cost of war that $P$ may or may not share, $M$ also receives a transfer of funds from $P$ in exchange for the greater winning probability. Such misalignment and differences in incentives will be examined more in the results. I will now provide the timing of the game more systematically to aid clarity:

1.  Nature moves and decides the state of the world.
2.  $M$ sends a signal to $P$, $s_1 = \{e, w\}$.
3.  $P$ updates their beliefs from the prior belief, $\mu_0$ to the posterior $\mu_1(s_1)$.
4.  $P$ chooses an action $a_1= \{e, w\}$. If $w$ is chosen, then payoffs are realized, and the game ends. If escalate is chosen, then the military power of $P$ and $M$ increases.
5.  Nature then chooses whether the players win, lose, or face a stalemate. Payoffs are realized.
6.  If a stalemate occurred, then round 2 repeats as above with the same state of the world as in round 1.
7.  $P$ updates their belief based on having survived to round 2 $\mu_2(s_1, r)$.
8.  $M$ sends a signal $s_2 = \{e, w\}$.
9.  $P$ updates their belief based on the signal to $\mu_2(r, s_2)$.
10. $P$ chooses $a_2= \{e, w\}$.
11. If $w$ is chosen, the game ends, and payoffs are realized. If escalate was chosen, Nature chooses if the players win or lose, payoffs are realized, and the game ends.

# Results

Note that just based on formalization, the Military can impact war duration in two ways. First, and most obviously, it impacts war duration through $m(\omega_E)$. The higher $m(\omega_E)$ is, the more likely the war is to end in a decisive victory. Similarly, the lower it is, the more likely they are to lose or prolong the conflict. Second, the Military impacts the duration of war through communications it sends to the Politician. This signal can be considered in two ways. It can be thought of as the Military's reports on battlefield outcomes, or it can be thought of as the product of military intelligence services. The game is a cheap talk game in that the signal $M$ sends is unverifiable, does not alter the structure of the game, and does not alter payoffs. As such, there is always an equilibrium in this game where $P$ ignores $M$'s signals and makes all decisions of whether to escalate or withdraw based on prior beliefs, which means that even in an equilibrium with honest communication, there is an equilibrium where $P$ ignores such communication. First, I will start with a broad overview of what conditions can produce an influential equilibrium. @lem-nec_cond starts broadly by outlining how $P$'s beliefs update throughout the whole paper and the conditions over players' preferences that are needed for the signal to influence the outcome of the game. After that, I explain the results in round 2, derive results for round 1, and then provide the total results for the game. The last section provides some brief comparative statics to assess how stable two equilibria are.

::: {#lem-nec_cond .lemma}
An influential equilibrium exists if and only if the following conditions hold:

1.  $M$ has different preferences over the outcome [@farrell1996CheapTalk].
2.  $P$'s beliefs change in response to $M$'s actions.
3.  $P$'s actions vary based on the signal received.
:::

The full proof is located in @sec-appendix, but it is helpful to walk through the logic of such an equilibrium to understand the different types of equilibria in the game and when a signal may produce an influential or babbling equilibrium. Addressing each of these conditions, first, for an equilibrium to be influential, $P$'s optimal strategy must change based on the state of the world. In either round, this requires that $P$ prefer to escalate when facing the weak type and to withdraw when facing the strong type, which entails the following two inequalities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(1)' > \frac{\lambda^2_P }{U_P'} >  m(0)'\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-assump_p_r2} 

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(1) + \frac{r(1)(\delta V_P'(\mu_2) + x_P)}{U_P} > \frac{\lambda^1_P}{U_P} > m(0) + \frac{r(0)(\delta V_P(\mu_2) + x_P)}{U_P}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-assump_p_r1}

Unless otherwise specified, I will assume that @eq-assump_p_r1, which applies to round 1, and @eq-assump_p_r2, which applies to round 2, hold. These inequalities ensure that $P$ has different preferences over outcomes and that the signal sent by $M$ potentially matters. If neither @eq-assump_p_r1 nor @eq-assump_p_r2 holds, communication does not matter, and the duration of the conflict is just a function of how the equation breaks. Next, I will show the two conditions where $M$ has different preferences over outcomes, leading with round 2: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(1)' > \frac{\lambda^2_M}{U_M'} > m(0)'\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-mpref_r2}

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(1) + \frac{r(1)(\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M)}{U_M} > \frac{\lambda^1_M}{U_M} > m(0) + \frac{r(0)(\delta V_M(\mu_2) + x_M)}{U_M}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-mpref_r1}

Second, communicating with $M$ must be able to change $P$'s beliefs. In other words, $P$ cannot simply decide based on their prior belief. $P$ must be able to learn something from the signal. Lastly, the signal should impact $P$'s actions. If $P$ updates their belief based upon the signal but still always prefers to escalate or withdraw, then the equilibrium cannot be influential. Next, it will be helpful to outline the logic behind the babbling equilibrium from $M$'s point of view.

::: {#lem-5 .lemma}
If @eq-mpref_r2 and @eq-mpref_r1 fail, then there is no influential equilibrium. $M$ can thus send any signal or combination of signals, and they are ignored.
:::

Again, the formal proof is in @sec-appendix. The logic is as follows: if $M$ has the same preference over outcomes, then they can choose any signal or mixture of signals, and $P$ will still ignore it. This occurs even when $P$ would be better off listening to $M$, but $M$ cannot send a trustworthy signal. If they could commit to some strategy that harmed them, they would always have an incentive to deviate if the other type was drawn. Hence, $P$ makes every move strictly based on their prior belief, and no matter the signal or mixture of signals $M$ sends, they cannot influence the duration of the war. Next, I'll explore how $P$'s beliefs update in round 2.

::: {#lem-4 .lemma}
If @eq-assump_p_r2 holds, then $P$'s optimal strategy can be determined with reference to their beliefs. The cut point for $P's$ beliefs where they choose to escalate can be defined with respect to a cutpoint in round 2. With regard to the weak type, when the belief is above the cut point, $P$ escalates; when it is below, $P$ withdraws.
:::

The proof is simply deriving the belief by construction and is laid out in @sec-appendix. The intuition is that given @eq-assump_p_r2 holds in round 2, $P$ wishes to escalate when they are more likely to win. Exactly how "certain" $P$ needs to be is defined exclusively regarding the second round payoff. This cutpoint is determined by the difference between how much $P$ gets backing down and the expected utility of winning against the strong type over the difference between the expected payoffs of escalating for the strong and weak types. $P$ makes this decision either based on the updated belief after a stalemate $\mu_2(s_1, r)$ or based on the updated belief off a signal, $\mu_2(r, s_2)$. Mathematically, this cutpoint can be represented as follows:

$$
\mu_2 (r, s_2)) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}
$$ {#eq-cutpoint2}

Where $\mu_2(s_1, r)$ is defined as follows: 

$$
\mu_2(r, s_2)= \frac{\mu_2(s_1, r) \cdot \sigma_M^1(e|\omega_E = 1)}{\mu_2(s_1, r) \cdot \sigma_M^1(e|\omega_E = 1) + (1 - (\mu_2(s_1, r)) \cdot \sigma_M^1(e|\omega_E = 0)}
$$

and the prior belief, $\mu_2(s_1, r)$, can be defined as follows:

$$
\mu_2(s_1, r) = \frac{\mu_1(s_1) \cdot r(1)}{\mu_1(s_1) \cdot r(1) + \mu_1(s_1) \cdot r(0)}
$$

Note that this strategy holds regardless of whether the prior or posterior belief is used. If $P$ can update its beliefs, it does, but the underlying logic of its strategy does not change. Next, I will define a babbling equilibrium in this game. The babbling equilibrium is useful as it serves as a "baseline" from which to compare the rest of the results. The babbling equilibrium will be outlined more fully in @prp-aligned1, but I present round 2's babbling here.

::: {#prp-unalign2 .proposition}
If @eq-mpref_r2 fails, then the only equilibrium in the second round is a babbling equilibrium, which is as follows:

$$
\sigma_P^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}
\end{cases}
$$

-   $P's$ updated belief is the prior belief, which is equal to the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_2(s_1, s_2) =  \mu_2(r, s_2)\\
\mu_2(r, s_2) =  \frac{r(1) \cdot p}{r(1) \cdot p + (1 - p) \cdot r(0)}
\end{aligned}
$$

-   Any strategy by $M$ is in equilibrium where $\sigma_P^{2*}$ is a probability distribution over the signals

$$
\sigma_M^{2*} \in [0, 1]
$$
:::

This proposition establishes the baseline case in round 2. When @eq-assump_p_r2 holds, @eq-mpref_r2 failing is sufficient to cause this result, which was derived in @lem-5. Because $M$'s preferences do not vary with the outcome, $P$ has no reason to trust the signal and thus cannot update the prior belief. $P$ always ignores $M$ and proceeds to escalate or withdraw based upon their prior belief. This means that occasionally, $P$ will make the wrong gamble. Their belief will be above (below) @eq-cutpoint_r2, but the state of the world will be $\omega = 1$ ($\omega = 0$). Even if, given the draw on the state of the world, it is in $M$'s best interest to tell the truth, the fact that they would have the incentive to lie in the counterfactual prohibits their signal from being influential. Substantively, if $P$ knows the Military always wants to continue the war or withdraw from the war, and that would not change regardless of the type of enemy, then $P$ always ignores $M$. Although it is sufficient for @eq-mpref_r2 to break for this to be an equilibrium, it is not necessary. Recall from @lem-nec_cond and @prp-unalign2 that a babbling equilibrium always exists. However, I will ignore such an equilibrium if it seems unlikely [@farrell1996CheapTalk].

::: {#prp-aligned2 .proposition}
If @eq-mpref_r2 holds in round 2, then there exists an influential equilibrium that is characterized by the following assessment:

$$
\sigma_P^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}

The logic of the proof is simple and follows @lem-5, @lem-nec_cond, and @lem-4. If @eq-mpref_r1 holds, then the first condition in @lem-nec_cond already holds. Next, $P$'s belief must change in response to $s_2$. Assume that such a signal is influential, then $P$ would be better off by heeding the signal if $M$ sends $s_2=e$ when $\omega_E = 1$ and sends $s_1=w$ when $\omega_E = 0$. Because $M$ has different strategies, which stem from different preferences over outcomes, and has information about the enemy, $P$ can learn about the state of the world. Hence, $P$ $\mu_2(r, s_2) = 1$ if $s_2 = e$ and $\mu_2(r, s_2)=0$[^4] if \$s_2 = w. Satisfying the second condition. Lastly, if @lem-4 is correct, then movements in beliefs can change $P$'s strategy. The beliefs listed before are just a special case of the more general strategy adopted by $P$. Hence, an influential equilibrium exists in round 2. We can now move on to lemmas from round 1 and more fully consider how the two-round structure impacts equilibrium behavior.

[^4]: The belief here is set t $0$ since it can not be updated using Bayesian methods since it would involve dividing by zero. Please see @sec-appendix for further details.

In essence, because the Politician knows that the Military has different preferences over outcomes, honest communication becomes possible. When $M$ communicates, there is an equilibrium where $P$ listens and updates their beliefs. Such learning allows $P$ to learn the state of the world and maximize their utility in this round.

Starting in round 1, we can more fully consider the conditions that allow for an influential equilibrium. It will be helpful to characterize the babbling equilibrium as a baseline and compare more fully in this section. Recall that @eq-mpref_r1 must hold for $M$ to satisfy the first condition in @lem-nec_cond. Recall that for the second condition in @lem-nec_cond, $P$'s beliefs must be updated. Similar to @lem-5, to obtain an influential equilibrium at all in round 1, we must also assume that @eq-assump_p_r1 holds.

::: {#lem-pbelief1 .lemma}
If @eq-assump_p_r1 holds, then $P$'s optimal strategy can be specified with reference to the round 1 belief and is defined as follows: 

$$
\sigma^{1*}_P = 
\begin{cases}
a_1= e  & \text{if } \quad\mu(s_1)
> \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_P + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)]

 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2))}
\end{cases}

The logic for @lem-pbelief1 follows the logic from round 2. However, the threshold is defined differently now. For the belief that they are facing the weak type, this threshold is defined concerning several things: first, the difference between the reservation value in round one and the payoff for escalating against the strong type. Second, the payoff for a stalemate when facing the strong type includes the stage payoff and the continuation value, which is discounted. This is all divided by the difference between the two war payoffs, the difference between the stalemates, and the difference between the continuation values. Intuitively, this makes sense since how confident $P$ has to be is weighted by the differences between payoffs and the payoff of facing the weak type. The exact continuation payoffs, $V_P(\mu_2)$, vary based upon the conjectured equilibrium. So, throughout the following equilibrium analysis, different values will be assumed to replace the continuation payoffs in relation to the equilibrium. For example, suppose we are conjecturing a separating equilibrium. In that case, we can conjecture the respective payoffs for escalating against the weak type for $V_P'(\mu_2)$ and the payoff for withdrawing when facing the strong type, $V_P(\mu_2)$.

If the Politician can not trust the Military to report on the enemy in round 1 or round 2, then the only information the Politician can use to update their beliefs is the fact that both the Politician and the enemy have survived. Because of the failure of @eq-mpref_r2 and @eq-mpref_r1, the equilibrium cannot meet the definition of an influential equilibrium laid out in @lem-nec_cond. As such, because the Politician knows they cannot trust the Military, the Military's signal does not impact their behavior. The Military uses any strategy or mixed strategy of signals, and they are ignored. Besides the assumptions about $P$'s preferences, no specific bounds are needed to maintain this equilibrium. It always exists and thus can serve as the full comparison case for how influential signals may influence the duration of a conflict. The first round decision is thus entirely determined by the prior probability, $p$, that the state of the world is $\omega_E = 1$. When $p$ is above (below) the cut point defined in @lem-pbelief1, then $P$ escalates (withdraws). Similarly, round 2's play is entirely determined by the prior belief and is updated based on $r(\omega_E)$. Escalation, while increasing $p$, also decreases the ability of $P$ to distinguish between states of the world without an informative signal.

The logic of the proof is rather simple. When the Military has different preferences over outcomes, satisfying the first condition in @lem-nec_cond, an influential equilibrium occurs. $M$ sends different signals based on the state of the world, and these signals cause $P$ to update their beliefs and change their actions. Because the Politician knows the Military has different preferences over outcomes, the signal is informative, and thus, they know exactly what type of enemy they are facing. Moreover, recall that since the belief from round 1 is used to update the stalemate belief, once the Politician learns the type of enemy, they do not become less certain. Compared to the babbling equilibrium in @prp-unaligned1, we can see already that the impact of the Military on war duration is non-monotonic. For example, in some cases, $\mu_0$ could be low enough that in a babbling equilibrium, $P$ would withdraw. However, in a separating equilibrium based on $\mu_1(s_1)$, if the state of the world were $\omega = 1$, then $P$ would escalate, thus prolonging the conflict.

Additionally, strict conditions must be met on the exogenous parameters for this honest communication to hold. These conditions are fully listed in @sec-appendix, but it suffices to say that nearly every parameter needs to be bounded between a condition related to $M$ and a condition related to $P$. This suggests that the conditions where $M$ can send an influential equilibrium are quite narrow. Only the probability parameters have uniform impacts on the equilibrium. The higher $r(1)$ or $m(1)$, the easier this equilibrium is to sustain. Similarly, the lower $r(0)$ or $m(0)$, the easier this equilibrium is to obtain. All other parameters are strictly bound, making this equilibrium very sensitive and unlikely to hold compared to other influential equilibrium.

## Influential Equilibrium with Babbling

Recall from @lem-nec_cond the conditions for an influential equilibrium. Because of the two-round structure of this game, there are equilibria where $M$ in round 1 does not have different preferences over outcomes but does in round 2. These equilibria are sensitive to different parameters' values, but equilibria exist when certain conditions are met. In round 1, $M$ has unilateral preferences over one outcome and thus babbles. In round 2, $M$ then "separates," creating an influential equilibrium. In this section, I will first present the different strategies that make this possible and then discuss them together. Similarly, since the strategies mirror each other, I will present both equilibrium propositions before discussing them.

::: {#lem-etow .lemma}
If @eq-mpref_r1 fails but @eq-mpref_r2 holds, then under certain assumptions on exogenous parameters, an equilibrium strategy exists for $M$ such that they babble in round 1 and separate in round 2 that is as follows: 
$$
\sigma^{*}_M = 
\begin{cases}
s_1 \in [0, 1] & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = \{0, 1\} \\
s_2 = e  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 1\\
s_2 = w  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 0\\

::: {#lem-wtoe .lemma}

s_1 = w  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = \{0, 1\}\\
s_2 = e  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 1\\
s_2 = w  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 0\\
\end{cases}
$$
:::

To understand @lem-etow, I will walk through $M$'s incentives in round 2 and then work back to round 1. In round 2, it must be the case that @eq-assump_p_r2 holds, meaning that $M$ has different preferences over outcomes in the second round. This equilibrium can be obtained in the first round when $M$ unilaterally prefers escalating. In such a scenario, after escalation occurs, the increase in resources with further escalation or the future increase in winning probability when facing the strong type is low enough to incentivize $M$ to separate. In other words, $M$ cannot be trusted in the first round precisely because continuing the war will benefit them. However, conditional on making it to the second round, once the war has continued, the decreased benefits of continuing the fight when facing the strong type mean that $M$ can now fill condition one of @lem-nec_cond. Hence, the decreasing resources of war open up possibilities for honest communication.

@lem-wtoe is the mirror of @lem-etow. This strategy entails that $M$ always prefers to withdraw in the first round. However, if $P$ escalates, then the gains from fighting the weak type are high enough to cause the types of $M$ to separate. Again, this different preference over outcomes now allows the possibility of an influential equilibrium to arise. In round 1, the costs of war continued to the resources $M$ already has, which are not preferred. If the Politician proceeds anyway, then the shifts in probability or gains from winning against a weak type allow for honest communication. The exogenous conditions needed to sustain both strategies in equilibrium will be discussed in the propositions.

These final two equilibria are interesting enough to deserve some focus since the Military's signal is ignored in round 1 but listened to in round 2. Note that the reverse is impossible based on the current setup since $P$ updates their belief in round 2 based on round 1, so if they learn the type in round 1, they cannot "unlearn" it. There are two ways that the Military becomes trustworthy, the first of which is more plausible given the current parameters and setup.

@prp-transition1 has some of the following characteristics that are worth commenting on. In round 1, $M$ prefers to escalate unilaterally and then recommends withdrawal when facing the weak type in round 2. This is primarily due to the potential increase in resources in the first round. Hence, the very act of escalating in round 1 for $P$ helps render the military untrustworthy. Any escalation involves devoting more resources to the Military and increases the chance of winning the war. However, the prospect of becoming more powerful helps make $M$ *less* trustworthy since $M$ now wishes to recommend escalating no matter what in round 1. However, as the war progresses, $M$ becomes trustworthy because the probability of beating the strong type is low, they have a low value, and they know continuing the war will result in fewer resources. The very costliness of war can thus align $M$'s incentives with $P$'s as the war progresses if we assume that the second round of escalation provides fewer resources than the first. Several conditions are needed to sustain this behavior. For example, an increase in $m(1)$, $r(1)$, $\delta$, or $x_m$ always make this equilibrium easier to sustain. Similarly, decreases in $r(0)$ always benefit this equilibrium. However, $m(0)$, $U_M$, and $\lambda^2_M$ all must be bounded very specifically. Moreover, the probability and $\delta$ conditions must simultaneously satisfy all of the values for $P$ in @prp-aligned1. This considerably narrows the range where this equilibrium is possible.

@prp-transition2 is the mirror of @prp-transition1 and thus displays similar behavior. In this equilibrium, the resources the Military already has, or the costs of war they would endure, are such that it would always make them prefer to withdraw in round 1. Communication between the Military and the politician is inhibited by the costliness of war this time. However, given that $P$ chooses escalation, $M$ separates and recommends escalating when $\omega_E = 0$. The lower the payoff for $\delta$, $x_m$, and $r(\omega_E)$, the easier this equilibrium is to sustain. However, winning probabilities and $U_M'$ must satisfy very specific conditions. Hence, given that $M$ has endured some costs and the escalation against a weak type in round 2 is high enough, $M$ will prefer to escalate against the weak type. In summary, honest communication is inhibited either by the transfer of resources or the costliness of war. Conditional on getting to round 2, an influential equilibrium becomes possible either due to the decrease in resources or the increase in resources or the probability of winning.

## Comparision

Holding all else steady, @prp-transition1 is very sensitive to changes in the utility of winning a war. $P$'s reservation value has little impact on the conflict, whereas $m(0)$ and $r(0)$ need to take on specific values again. @fig-statics shows the results of the analysis. The $Y$ axis is whether the equilibrium is satisfied or not, while the x-axis shows the particular value of the parameter. Considering some of the parameters are unbounded when it comes to maintaining $M$'s strategy, it seems probable that, given how bounded each expression needs to be, a fully honest equilibrium would be even harder to maintain.

Since a babbling equilibrium always exists [@farrell1996CheapTalk], we can compare the results in the paper to any equilibrium outcome. In this way, the babbling equilibrium stands as a "baseline" where the sources of learning are just the outcomes of the battle. Note that $P$ always does at least as well under an influential equilibrium ex-ante as under a babbling equilibrium. To see this, assume that the the game is such that the probability that the state of the world is $\omega_E = 1$ is high. Assume that $u_0$ is sufficiently high and passes the cutpoint in @lem-pbelief1. Moreover, assume that if $P$ makes it to round 2 $\mu_2(s_1, r)$, will be above the cutpoint defined in @eq-cutpoint2. Even if an equilibrium is a babbling equilibrium, $P$ will continue to escalate because of the high prior probabilities.

To see that $P$ is at least as well off, assume that an equilibrium is influential. Keeping all other assumptions above the same. In such an equilibrium, even one of the ones where it only occurs in the second round, $P$ would escalate in round 1, and then in round 2, it would learn the true state of the world. $P$ would thus escalate again at the final round, obtaining their highest payoff. Alternatively, if the true state of the world was actually $\omega_E = 0$, then $P$ would withdraw at the last round, thus doing better than they would in a babbling equilibrium. Hence, in an influential equilibrium, $P$ always does at least as well as they would in a babbling equilibrium, even one, when the equilibrium is babbling in round one and separating in round 2. Hence, honest communication, even if only in the second round, always benefits $P$.

# Discussion

Recall that the Military does two things in war: it fights the war and provides information on how the battle went. In this model, the Military's messaging strategy does not have a single monotonic effect on conflict. In some scenarios, an informative equilibrium is associated with a longer war, and in others, with a shorter war. Suppose that the state of the world is such that $\omega_E = 0$ but that $P$'s prior belief is high enough to result in prolonged conflict. In such a scenario, an informative equilibrium is associated with a shorter war, but clearly, it need not always be. Assume that instead, $\omega_E = 1$ and $\mu_0$ are just below the cutpoint defined in @lem-pbelief1. In a babbling equilibrium, this results in a shorter war. However, in an influential equilibrium, $P$ may instead be informed about the state of the world and choose to continue the war. However, such a result could be due to the modeling technology employed here. Note that if we added a third player and bargaining, as in @slantchevPrincipleConvergenceWartime2003, then informative equilibrium would be associated with bargaining. If such a signal led to complete information bargaining, the game would likely end in peace [@fearonRationalistExplanationsWar1995]. Influential equilibrium would likely be associated with shorter wars under such scenarios.

However, the strict conditions needed to ensure this equilibrium mean sthis equilibrium is hard to satisfy. As seen @fig-statics, even the equilibrium with partial communication is relatively sensitive. For fully honest communication, nearly every exogenous parameter is bounded between two values for $M$ and $P$. As such, the existence of this equilibrium is unlikely to hold unless under narrow conditions. Conversely, @prp-transition1 holds under a range, even if it is a narrow range, of parameters and is thus more likely to come up. This is largely due to the different boundary conditions needed for @prp-transition1 since strictly increasing some parameters helps obtain this equilibrium.

Substantively, we can treat this as follows: Early in a war, information from the Military will likely be thrown out. It is unlikely that both the Politician and the Military will have the same preferences over outcomes early in the conflict because escalating a conflict in this model funnels away resources from "butter" or other projects [@powell1999shadow] and funds the Military. Of course, funding the Military is how you arm and train personnel and, therefore, how you win a war, but the very act of funding the Military may change preferences over outcomes. Earlier in the battle, and if the transfer of resources is large and the costs of the war relatively low, the Military obtains more resources; but as the war goes on, and the transfer of future resources takes on a specific bound, then war may incentivize honest communication. However, equilibria like @prp-transition1 are sensitive to changes in parameters. This may imply that honest communication between the Military and the Politician is unlikely to happen early in the war and is only likely to happen to the degree that continued war allows the Military to have diverging preferences over outcomes.

# Conclusion

In this model, I have attempted to explain under what conditions the Military and Politican can have honest communication about a war effort and to see how that impacts war duration. I have found that there are narrow conditions under which the Military can provide credible information during a war and that when these situations occur, it is likely to come after more escalation. Moreover, the power shift at the start of the game is key to this model. While something that impacts power in the middle of a conflict may seem counterintuitive, there are plenty of examples of such a scenario throughout history. We may think of mass illness during war or perhaps wartime aid and funding as some examples. One historical example comes from the French Invasion of Russia of 1812. During the French Invasion of Russia in 1812, on the long march to Moscow, the French army began to lose soldiers, not to the cold but to disease [@mikaberidzeLimitsOperationalArt2016; @taltyIllustriousDeadTerrifying2009a]. While Napoleon toured his camps and asked how many men were healthy and ready to fight, his soldiers constantly inflated the numbers of soldiers that were healthy in the grand armee [@mikaberidzeLimitsOperationalArt2016]; hence, the political leaders at the time could not account for the full strength of their army due to incentives for parts of the Military to misrepresent the truth. In this illustrative example, Napoleon's soldiers possess private information that the leader does not possess. The leader would be better off with that information, but the signal was effectively ignored because of the soldiers' incentives always to report that they were doing well. Following his prior belief and having started with around 700,000 soldiers [@jankauskas2012IncideruntItaqueFossam], Napoleon believed he was highly likely to win. The signals of his soldiers and men were treated as babbling as they all said primarily things Napoleon wanted to hear [@gompert2014NapoleonsInvasionRussia].

While we cannot know the counterfactual of how long the war would continue had political leaders known the full extent of the losses, the fact that it took until after Moscow was conquered for Napoleon to make a hectic retreat is suggestive [@gompert2014NapoleonsInvasionRussia]. Those who do the fighting, the dying, and presumably the learning must report these changes to those who make decisions. Without such reports, political leaders may learn more slowly from events than they otherwise could. Another potential source of exogenous asymmetric information, all but on the costs side, involves leader turnover. New leaders who come into office shortly before or during a conflict have different levels of resolve and may be more likely to prolong a conflict. One potential statistical test of my argument would involve leader transitions for a particular dyad with a conflict.

Another empirical implication is that leaders would seem to be more likely to listen to the Military as the war progresses. Early on, when the Military is eager to extract resources, it is unlikely that the Politician will treat the Military as anything other than a babbling equilibrium. However, the cost of war and the more minimal transfer of resources may open up avenues of communication.

## Proofs

### Proof of @lem-4

::: proof
Let us find a threshold for the belief that the state of the world is $\omega_E = 1$ given some strategy by $M$. Again, assume that @eq-assump_p_r2 holds, then the following expresses the threshold for the belief for $P$ that they will escalate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_2(r, s_2) \cdot m(1)' \cdot U_P' + (1 - \mu_2(r, s_2)) \cdot m(0)' \cdot U_P' > \lambda^2_P \\
\mu_2(r, s_2) [m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'] +  m(0)' \cdot U_P' > \lambda^2_P\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\mu_2(r, s_2) > \frac{\lambda^2_P -  m(0)' \cdot U_P'}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}
$$ {#eq-cutpoint_r2}

Given @eq-assump_p_r2, then $P$ must play as follows in round 2 

$$
\sigma_P^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(r, s_2) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(r, s_2) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}
\end{cases}
$$
:::

### Proof of @prp-unalign2

If @eq-mpref_r2 fails, then the only equilibrium in the second round is a babbling equilibrium, which is as follows:

$$
\sigma_P^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}
\end{cases}
$$

-   $P's$ updated belief is the prior belief, which is equal to the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_2(s_1, s_2) =  \mu_2(r, s_2)\\
\mu_2(r, s_2) =  \frac{r(1) \cdot p}{r(1) \cdot p + (1 - p) \cdot r(0)}
\end{aligned}
$$

-   Any strategy by $M$ is in equilbrium where $\sigma_P^{2*}$ is a probability distribution over the signals

$$
\sigma_M^{2*} \in [0, 1]
$$

Hence, a PBE consists of the following three objects

$[\sigma_P^{2*}, \sigma_M^{2*},  \mu_2(r, s_2])$

::: proof
Since @eq-mpref_r2 fails, and as shown in @lem-nec_cond, we know that this equilibrium will be a babbling equilibrium. Because we assume that @eq-assump_p_r2 holds, $P$ prefers to escalate when facing the weak type and withdraw when facing the strong type. @lem-4 gives us the cutoff for what $P$ has to believe to escalate. As such, all that is left is to define the beliefs and how they are updated.

First, let us define $\mu_2(s_1, r)$. Such a belief is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_2(s_1, r) = \frac{Pr(\text{stalemate}|\omega_E=1)}{Pr(\text{stalemate})}\\
= \frac{r(1) p}{r(1)p + (1 - p) r(0)} 
\end{aligned}
$$

The posterior belief after $M$ sends a signal in the final round is defined as follows:

$$
\mu_2(r, s_2) = \frac{\mu_2(s_1, r) \cdot \sigma_M^2(s_2 = e|\omega=1)}{\mu_2(s_1, r) \cdot \sigma_M^2(s_2 = e|\omega=1) + [1 - \mu_2(s_1, r)] \cdot \sigma_M^2(s_2 = e|\omega=0)}
$$

However, according to @lem-5, no updating can occur since $M$'s signal is ignored. Hence $\mu_2(r, s_2) = \mu_2(s_1, r)$.This means that $P$'s action is entirely determined by $\mu_2(r, s_2)$ as shown in @lem-4. Moreover, there are no strong conditions or boundaries to put on this equilibrium so long as @eq-assump_p_r2 holds, then this babbling equilibrium always exists [@farrell1996CheapTalk] since the only necessary condition is $P$'s preferences. Putting it all together, the following is the equilibrium assessment:

$$
\sigma_P^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_2(r, s_2) =  \mu_2(s_1, r)\\
\mu_2(s_1, r) =  \frac{r(1) \cdot p}{r(1) \cdot p + (1 - p) \cdot r(0)}
\end{aligned}
$$ 
$$
\sigma_M^{2*} \in [0, 1]
$$

:::

### Proof of @prp-aligned2

If @eq-mpref_r2 holds in round 2, then there exists an influential equilibrium that is characterized by the following assessment:

$$
\sigma_P^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\mu_2(r, s_2) =
\begin{cases} 
 = 1 & \text{if } \quad s_2 = e \\
= 0 & \text{if } \quad s_2 = w  \\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\sigma_M^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
s_2 =  e & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 1 \\
s_2 =  w & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 0 \\
\end{cases}
$$

::: proof
Recall the necessary conditions needed for an influential equilibrium. The first condition is met in the second round based on @eq-mpref_r2. The proof thus needs to show that $P$ learns $M$ and that these signals change $P$'s behavior in order for an equilibrium to be influential.

Since, @eq-mpref_r2 holds, if the equilbirum is influential then $M$ must have the following optimal strategy:

$$
\sigma_M^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
s_2 =  e & \text{if } \quad \omega_E=1 \\
s_2 = w & \text{if} \quad \omega_E= 0\\
\end{cases}
$$

Next, we see if, in turn, $P$ updates their beliefs. Suppose the state of the world is $\omega_E = 1$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_2(r, s_2) = \frac{\mu_(s_1, r) \cdot 1}{\mu(w|S) \cdot 1 + (1 - \mu_(s_1, r) \cdot 0}\\
= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Suppose instead that the state of the world is instead $\omega_E = 1$, then $P$ updates their belief as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_2(r, s_2) = \frac{\mu_(s_1, r) \cdot 0}{\mu_(s_1, r)\cdot 0 + (1 - \mu_(s_1, r)) \cdot 0}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly, you cannot divide by zero. As such, we cannot use Bayes rule here. I thus set the belief to $0$ since if we were to define the mirror belief of $\mu_2(r, s_2)$ as to whether a strong type exists, it would be $1$.

Since $P$'s belief changes based on the signal, we have the second part of the necessary condition. Lastly, we simply need to check how $P$'s actions change. Since the decision rule outlined in @lem-4 still holds, and we are still assuming @eq-assump_p_r2, the following is an equilibrium strategy: 
$$
\sigma_P^{2*} = 
\begin{cases} 
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}
\end{cases}
$$

This equilibrium is a special case where the belief equals $1$ or $0$. Thus, we have the third part of the necessary condition, and $P$'s actions change based upon $M$'s signal, and $P$ escalates when $\omega_E=1$ and withdraws when $\omega_E=0$.

A number of conditions need to hold for an influential separating equilibrium to be possible, but I will address these in @prp-aligned1.
:::

### Proof of @lem-pbelief1

*If @eq-assump_p_r1 holds, then* $P$'s optimal strategy in round 1 can be specified with reference to the round 1 belief and is thus defined as follows:

$$
\sigma^{1*}_P = 
\begin{cases}
a_1= e  & \text{if } \quad\mu(s_1)
> \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_P + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)] 
 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2))}\\
a_1 = w  & \text{if } \mu(s_1)
< \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_p + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)] 
 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2))}
\end{cases}
$$

::: proof
The belief is obtained by construction, while the cut point is found by how confident $P$ has to be in the weak type relative to their expected payoffs for the game.

$$
\mu(s_1) = \frac{p \cdot \sigma^1_M}{p \cdot \sigma^1_M + (1 - p) \cdot \sigma^1_m(e|t = s)}
$$

The cut point is defined as follows:

$$

### Proof of @prp-unaligned1

If @eq-mpref_r1 and @eq-mpref_r2 fail and @eq-assump_p_r1 holds, then there must be a babbling equilibrium that consists of the following elements:

$$
\sigma^{*}_P = 
\begin{cases}
a_1= e  & \text{if } \quad\mu(s_1)
> \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_P + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)] 
 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2)}\\
a_1 = w  & \text{if } \mu(s_1)
< \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_p + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)] 
 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2))}\\

\end{cases}
$$

Any signal or mixture of signals is in equilibrium for $M$:

$$
\sigma^{*}_M \in [0, 1]
$$

Moreover, $P$'s belief always equals the prior belief.

$$
\mu^*= 
\begin{cases}
p  & \text{in } \quad \text{round 1}\\
\mu_2(s_1, r)  & \text{in } \quad \text{round 2}\\
\end{cases}
$$

::: proof
The proof is primarily a matter of combining previous lemmas and propositions. $P$'s optimal strategy and beliefs for round two are proved in @prp-unalign2, and their optimal strategy and beliefs for round 1 are proved in @lem-pbelief1. Similarly, the fact that $M$ can play any strategy comes from @lem-5.

Because $M$'s signal is always treated as noise and ignored, $M$ sends any signal. Because we have assumed that @eq-assump_p_r1 holds, $P$'s optimal beliefs are simple. If their belief is above the threshold @eq-beliefr1 then they escalate, and if their belief is below the threshold @eq-beliefr1 they withdraw. If a stalemate occurs, then $P$ revises their belief. Again, if their belief is above the threshold defined in @prp-unalign2, they escalate, and if it is below that cutpoint, they withdraw. Prior probabilities and the general cutpoints in the model entirely determine $P$'s welfare.

### Proof of @prp-aligned1

If @eq-assump_p_r1, @eq-mpref_r1, and the number of specifications specified below all hold, then an influential equilibrium exists where separating occurs and is of the following character:

$$
\sigma^{*}_M = 
\begin{cases}
s = e  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 1\\
s = w  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 0 \\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\sigma^{*}_P = 
\begin{cases}
a_1= e  & \text{if } \quad\mu(s_1)
> \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_P + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)] 
 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2)}\\
a_1 = w  & \text{if } \mu(s_1)
< \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_p + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)] 
 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2))}\\
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\mu^* = 
\begin{cases}
\mu_1(s_1) = 1 & \text{ if} \quad t = w\\
\mu(t= s| \sigma^{*}_m) = 1 & \text{ if} \quad t = s
\end{cases}
$$

::: proof
If $M$ fully separates in round 1, then $P$ knows with certainty the type of enemy they are facing. Hence, @eq-mpref_r2 becomes irrelevant to this equilibrium. All that matters is $M$'s preferences over outcomes in round 1. Two things must be true for $M$ to fully separate in the first period: First, @eq-mpref_r1 must hold

$$
m(1) + \frac{r(1)(\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M)}{U_M} > \frac{\lambda^1_M}{U_M} > m(0) + \frac{r(0)(\delta V_M(\mu_2) + x_M)}{U_M}\\
$$

Second, @eq-assump_p_r1 must hold for $P$ to care at all about separating signals:

$$
m(1) + \frac{r(1)'(\delta V_P'(\mu_2) + x_P)}{U_P} > \frac{\lambda^1_P}{U_P} > m(0) + \frac{r(0)'(\delta V_P(\mu_2) + x_P)}{U_p}\\
$$

Assume that such an equilibrium exists. If it does, then we know the continuation payoffs are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_P(\mu) = \lambda^2_P\\
V_P'(\mu)  = U_P' m(1)''\\
V_M(\mu)  = \lambda^2_M\\
V_M'(\mu)  = U_M' m(1)'' \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The first part of the proof is essentially a piecing together of previous results. All of the round two results come from @prp-aligned2, such as optimal strategies for both players and round 2 beliefs. $P$'s optimal strategies come from @lem-pbelief1, and $M$'s behavior comes from @prp-aligned2 and @lem-nec_cond. $P$'s beliefs are always certain, as I demonstrate by construction. When the enemy is weak, then $P$ updates their beliefs as follows:

$$
\mu_1(s_1) = \frac{p \cdot \ 1}{p \cdot 1+ (1 - p) \cdot 0} = 1
$$

Moreover, because they know the enemy is weak in round 1, this translates to round 2's beliefs:

$$
\mu_2(s_1, r) = \frac{r(1) \cdot \ 1}{r(1) \cdot 1+ r(0)\cdot 0} = 1
$$

The second part of the proof involves the manipulation of the utility equations of $M$ and $P$ to see what values of exogenous variables can sustain this equilibrium. Several parameters must fall in boundary conditions. First, $\delta$, the common discount factor must satisfy many inequalities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M m(1) + r(1)(\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M) > \lambda^1_M\\
\delta > \frac{\lambda^1_M - U_M m(1) - r(1)x_M}{ U_M' m(1)'r(1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M m(0) + r(0)(\delta V_M(\mu_2) + x_M) <\lambda^1_M\\
\delta < \frac{\lambda^1_M - U_M m(0) - r(0)x_M}{ \lambda^2_Mr(0)}
\end{aligned}
$$

This means the following must hold:

$$
\frac{\lambda^1_M - U_M m(1) - r(1)x_M}{ U_M' m(1)'r(1)}<\delta < \frac{\lambda^1_M- U_M m(0) - r(0)x_M}{ \lambda^2_M r(0)}
$$ {#eq-delta_sep_m}

The mirror inequality results in the following inequality that $\delta$ must satisfy with respect to $P$

$$
\frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(1) - r(1)x_P}{ U_P' m(1)'r(1)}<\delta < \frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(0) - r(0)x_P}{ \lambda^2_P r(0)}
$$ {#eq-delta_sep_p}

Next, let us find what $P$'s utility for victory must be to sustain such an equilibrium. For $P$, recall that their resources diminish with each round. As such, we can rewrite the second round utility of winning as follows: $U_P' = U_P - \Delta U_P$. In turn, this allows us to rewrite the inequality below: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_P m(1) + r(1)(V_P(\mu_2)'\delta + x_P) > \lambda^1_P\\
U_P > \frac{\lambda^1_P - r(1)'[ \Delta U_P m(1)' \delta - x_P]}{m(1) + r(1)\delta m(1)'}
\end{aligned}
$$

A similar process for the other side of the inequality leaves us with the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{ \lambda^1_P - r(0)[\lambda^2_P \delta + x_P]}{m(0)} > U_P > \frac{\lambda^1_P - r(1)'[ \Delta U_P m(1)' \delta + x_P]}{m(1) + r(1)\delta m(1)'}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-win_sep_p}

Performing the same comparison for $M$ while bearing in mind that $U_M' = U_M + \Delta U_M$ reveals the following inequality

$$
\frac{\lambda^1_M - r(0)[\delta \lambda^2_M + x_P]}{m(0)} > U_M > \frac{\lambda^1_M- r(1)[\Delta U_M \delta m(1)'  + x_P]}{m(1)}
$$

Lastly, stage payoffs need to be examined. $x_M$ must take on the following values:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M m(1) + r(1)(\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M) > \lambda^1_M\\
x_M > \frac{\lambda^1_M-U_M m(1) - r(1)\delta U_M'm(1)' }{r(1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Which amounts to the following inequality:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda^1_M -U_M m(1) - r(1)\delta U_M'm(1)' }{r(1)}<x_M < \frac{\lambda^1_M-U_M m(0) - r(0)\delta\lambda^2_M}{r(0)}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-stage_sep_m}

A similar process reveals the following for $P$

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_P m(1) + r(1)(V_P'(\mu_2)\delta + x_P) > \lambda^1_P\\
x_P > \frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(1) - r(1)U_P' m(1)' \delta}{r(1)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Which entails the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(0) - r(0) \lambda^2_P \delta}{r(0)} > x_P > \frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(1) - r(1)U_P' m(1)' \delta}{r(1)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-stage_sep_p}

For both players, the following being either strictly higher or lower helps sustain the equilibrium: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
U_i m(1) + r(1)[ \delta V_i'(\mu_2) + x_i] > \lambda^1_i\\
m(1) > \frac{\lambda^1_i -r(1)[\delta V_i'(\mu_2) + x_i ]}{U_i}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_i m(1) + r(1)[ \delta V_i'(\mu_2) + x_i] > \lambda^1_i\\
r(1) > \frac{\lambda^1_i - U_i m(1)}{[\delta V_i'(\mu_2) + x_i ]}
\end{aligned}
$$

The mirror expression that needs to be as small as possible is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(0) < \frac{\lambda^1_i -r(0)[\delta V_i(\mu_2) + x_i ]}{U_i}
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
\begin{aligned}
r(0) < \frac{\lambda^1_i - U_i m(0)}{[\delta V_i(\mu_2) + x_i ]}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Proof of @lem-etow

*If @eq-mpref_r1 fails such that* $M$ always prefers to escalate, but @eq-mpref_r2 holds, then an equilibrium strategy exists for $M$ such that they babble in round 1 and separate in round 2:

$$
\sigma^{*}_M = 
\begin{cases}
s_1 \in [0, 1] & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = \{0, 1\} \\
s_2 = e  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 1\\
s_2 = w  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 0\\
\end{cases}
$$

:::::: proof
If @eq-stratm_e_sep holds in equilibrium, then $M$ babbles in the first round and then separates in the second round.

Examining the first possibility lets us see what conditions must hold for $M$ for @eq-stratm_e_sep to be an equilibrium strategy. Assume that such an equilibrium exists. If so, then if $M$ reaches the second round, the continuation payoffs follow the form of the separating equilibrium in that the following is true for either strategy:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_M(\mu)  = \lambda^2_M\\
V_M'(\mu)  = U_M' m(1)'\\
\end{aligned}
$$

In such an equilibrium, $U_M$ needs to satisfy two conditions:

First, in the second round, the following must hold:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M' m(0) < \lambda^2_M\\
U_M < \frac{\lambda^2_M - \Delta U_M m(0)'}{m(0)''}\\
\frac{\lambda^2_M - \Delta U_M m(1)'}{m(1)}< U_M < \frac{\lambda^2_M - \Delta U_M m(0)'}{m(0)''}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Then, in round two, the following $M$ always prefers to escalate; hence, the following must hold

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M' m(0) + r(0)[\delta V_M(\mu_2) + x_M] > \lambda^1_M\
U_M > \frac{\lambda^1_M- r(0)[\delta \lambda^2_M + x_M]}{m(0)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

This entails the following relationship for $U_M$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda^2_M - \Delta U_M m(0)'}{m(0)''} > U_M > \frac{\lambda^1_M- r(0)[\delta \lambda^2_M + x_M]}{m(0)}\\
\frac{\lambda^2_M- \Delta U_M m(0)'}{m(0')} > \frac{\lambda^1_M - r(0)[\delta \lambda^2_M + x_M]}{m(0)}\\
\lambda^2_M [m(0) + r(0)\delta m(0)'] + m(0)'[x_M r(0) - \lambda^1_M] - \Delta U_M m(0)'m(0) >0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$m(0)$ and $x_M$ must also take on specific values to hold. In round 2, $m(0)$ must satisfy the following condition

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M' m(0)' < \lambda^2_M\\
m(0) < \frac{\lambda^2_M - \Delta m(0) U_M'}{U_M'}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

And in round 1, the following must hold:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M m(0) + r(0)[\lambda_M^2 \delta + x_M] > \lambda^1_M\\
m(0) > \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(0)[\lambda_M^2\delta + x_M]}{U_M} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Which entails the following inequality and relationship

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda_M^2 - \Delta m(0) U_M'}{U_M'}  > m(0) > \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(0)[\lambda_M^2 \delta + x_M]}{U_M}\\
\frac{\lambda_M^2 - \Delta m(0) U_M'}{U_M'} > \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(0)[\lambda_M^2 \delta + x_M]}{U_M}\\
0 >  \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(0)[\lambda_M^2 \delta + x_M]}{U_M} - \frac{\lambda_M^2- \Delta m(0) U_M'}{U_M'}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Next, note that the following parameters show that this equilibrium is increasingly likely to hold as $\delta$, $r(1)$, $x_M$, and $m(1)$ increase.

Since $\delta$ only appears in the first round, we need only examine that round. Moreover, note that the conditions will be identical. So we can write this equation more generally as follows and then isolate $\delta$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M m(\omega_E) + r(\omega_E)[\delta V_M(\mu_2) + x_M] > \lambda_M^1\\
\delta > \frac{\lambda_M^1 - U_M m(\omega_E) - r(\omega_E) x_M}{V_M(\mu_2) \cdot r(\omega_E) \cdot \delta}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$r(1)$ follows the same pattern and must satisfy the following inequality

$$
\begin{aligned}
r(1) > \frac{\lambda_M^1- U_M m(1)}{\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$x_M$ satisfies a similar inequality

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_M < \frac{\lambda_M^1- U_M m(\omega_E) - r(\omega_E) V_M'(\mu_2) \delta}{r(\omega_E)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Recall that $m(1)' = m(1) + \Delta m(1)$, then we can rewrite the inequality as

$$
m(1) > \frac{\lambda_M^1- r(1) \delta U_M' \Delta m(1) - r(1) x_M}{U_M + r(1) \delta U_M'}
$$

### Proof of @lem-wtoe

*If @eq-assump_p_r1 fails but @eq-assump_p_r2 holds, then there is a specification of the parameters where the following strategy is the best response for* $M$:

s_2 = e  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 1\\
s_2 = w  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 0\\
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-stratm_w_sep}

::: proof
The proof is by construction. If @eq-stratm_w_sep is to hold, then the following must be true for the parameters within the model:

First, $m(1)$ must satisfy the following conditions in round 2:

$$
m(1) > \frac{\lambda_M^2- \Delta m(1) U_M'}{U_M'}
$$

In round 1, the following must hold, which allows us to derive a more general condition:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M' m(1) + r(1)[\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M] < \lambda_M^1\\
m(1) < \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(1)[\delta U_M' \Delta m(1) + x_M]}{U_M + r(1) \delta} \\
\frac{\lambda_M^2 \Delta m(1) U_M'}{U_M'} <  \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(1)[\delta U_M' \Delta m(1) + x_M]}{U_M + r(1) \delta}\\
 0<\frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(1)[\delta U_M' \Delta m(1)' + x_M]}{U_M + r(1)' \delta} - \frac{\lambda_M^2}{U_M'} + \Delta m(1) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Second, $U_M$ must satisfy the following condition in round 2:

$$
\frac{\lambda_M^2}{m(0)'}> U_M' > \frac{\lambda_M^2}{m(1)'}
$$

The following must hold in round 1, which leads to a more general bound on $U_M$

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M' m(1) + r(1)[\delta U_M' m(1)' + x_M]) < \lambda_M^1\\
U_M' < \frac{\lambda_M^1- U_M m(1) - r(1) x_M}{r(1) \delta m(1)'} \\
\frac{\lambda_M^2}{m(1)'} < \frac{\lambda_M^1 - U_M m(1) - r(1) x_M}{r(1) \delta m(1)'} \\
0 < \lambda_M^1 - U_M m(1) - r(1) x_M - \lambda_M^2 r(1) \delta \\
\end{aligned}
$$

This equilibrium also makes it easier to maintain when some parameters are lower. $\delta$ must obey the following inequality:

$$
\delta < \frac{\lambda_M^1 - U_M m(\omega_E) - r(\omega_E) x_M}{r(\omega_E) V_M(\mu_2)}
$$

The lower any first-round probability is, the easier the equilibrium is to sustain:

$$
r(\omega_E) < \frac{\lambda_M^1- U_M m(\omega_E)}{\delta V_M(\mu_2) + x_M}
$$

$$
m(0) <  \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(0)[V_M(\mu_2) \delta + x_M])}{U_M}
$$

However, in the second stage, the change in the probability when facing the weak type drives this equilibrium strategy; hence, the second escalation probability when facing the weak type has to hold to the following structure, and the equilibrium is always easier to sustain the greater it is:

$$
m(1)' > \frac{\lambda_M^2}{U_M'}
$$

Moreover, the lower the stage payoff, the more likely this is to hold

$$
x_M < \frac{U_M m(\omega_E) - r(\omega_E) \delta}{r(\omega_E)}
$$

::: proof
$M$'s optimal strategy follows is shown in @lem-etow. $P$'s strategies similarly come from different lemmas. Consider the rounds separately. In round 1, $P$ is playing the babbling equilibrium outlined in @prp-unaligned1 and must decide based on their priors. If $P$ makes it to round 2, the signal becomes seperating per @lem-etow. The logic of the equilibrium is as follows. Suppose that the state of the world is such that $\omega_E = 1$. However, suppose that $\mu_1(s_1)$ is below the threshold defined in @lem-pbelief1. Moreover, suppose that the equilibrium is sensitive and that such withdrawal changes the continuation payoffs to just enough to make @eq-mpref_r1 hold, so now the continuation payoffs are

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_M(\mu)  = 0\\\
V_M(\mu)'  = 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

And @eq-mpref_r1 holds. Hence, $M$ would have an incentive to deviate to a strategy where their signals are not treated as babbling. However, suppose that this was the case, then the continuation payoffs would revert to @lem-etow, and again, such a strategy would be unsustainable. $M$ is treated as babbling in the first round even if ex-ante, they would prefer to tell the truth precisely because if their signal was treated as informative, they would have an incentive to lie.

Moreover, even though $P$ knows they will receive an informative signal in the next round, they still need to escalate if they are confident they are facing the strong type. $P$'s incentives and beliefs have not changed from @lem-etow. If $P$ moves to round 2, they will know perfectly about the enemy type. Hence, we can pull from @prp-aligned2 and see that $P$ will update their beliefs and strategy based perfectly on the enemy type.

As stated in @lem-etow, several conditions need to hold for this equilibrium to be sustainable. In addition to all of the conditions on parameters outlined for $M$, all of the following need to hold for $P$ from the separating @prp-aligned1: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{ \lambda^1_P - r(0)[\lambda^2_P \delta + x_P]}{m(0)} > U_P > \frac{\lambda^1_P - r(1)'[ \Delta U_P m(1)' \delta + x_P]}{m(1) + r(1)\delta m(1)'}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(0) - r(0) \lambda^2_P \delta}{r(0)} > x_P > \frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(1) - r(1)U_P' m(1)' \delta}{r(1)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(1) > \frac{\lambda^1_P -r(1)[\delta V_P'(\mu_2) + x_P ]}{U_P}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
r(1) > \frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(1)}{[\delta V_P'(\mu_2) + x_P ]}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(0) < \frac{\lambda^1_P -r(0)[\delta V_P(\mu_2) + x_P]}{U_P}
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
\begin{aligned}
r(0) < \frac{\lambda^1_P - U_P m(0)}{[\delta V_P(\mu_2) + x_P ]}
\end{aligned}
$$

Simultaneously, all of the following need to hold from @lem-etow 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda_M^2 - \Delta U_M m(1)'}{m(1)}< U_M < \frac{\lambda_M^2 - \Delta U_M m(0)'}{m(0)''}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\lambda_M^2 - \Delta m(0) U_M'}{U_M'}  > m(0) > \frac{\lambda_M^1- r(0)[\lambda_M^2 \delta + x_M]}{U_M}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}\
\delta > \frac{\lambda_M^1 - U_M m(\omega_E) - r(\omega_E) x_M}{V_M (\mu_2)\cdot r(\omega_E) \cdot \delta}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
r(1) > \frac{\lambda_M^1 - U_M m(1)}{\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ 
$$
\begin{aligned}
x_M > \frac{\lambda_M^1- U_M m(\omega_E) - r(\omega_E) V_M'(\mu_2) \delta}{r(\omega_E)}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
m(1) > \frac{\lambda_M^1- r(1) \delta U_M' \Delta m(1) - r(1) x_M}{U_M + r(1) \delta U_M'}
$$

Recall that the assumptions from @lem-5 and @lem-nec_cond need to hold as well and that the following must be true in round 1

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(1) + \frac{r(1)(\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M)}{U_M} >  m(0) + \frac{r(0)(\delta V_M(\mu_2) + x_M)}{U_M} > \frac{\lambda_M^1}{U_M} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(1)' > \frac{\lambda^2_P }{U_P'} >  m(0)'\\
\end{aligned}
$$

For an equilibrium to be influential due to behavior in round 1, this entails the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m(1) + \frac{r(1)(\delta V_P'(\mu_2) + x_P)}{U_P} > \frac{\lambda^1_P}{U_P} > m(0) + \frac{r(0)(\delta V_P(\mu_2) + x_P)}{U_P}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

### Proof of @prp-transition2

IIf @eq-assump_p_r2, @eq-mpref_r2, and @lem-etow hold, and @eq-mpref_r1 fails such that $M$ always prefers $w$, then following is an influential equilibrium assessment:

$$
\sigma^{*}_M = 
\begin{cases}
s_1 \in [0, 1] & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = \{0, 1\} \\
s_2 = e  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 1\\
s_2 = w  & \text{if } \quad \omega_E = 0\\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\sigma^{*}_P = 
\begin{cases}
a_1= e  & \text{if } \quad\mu(s_1)
> \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_P + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)] 
 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2)}\\
a_1 = w  & \text{if } \mu(s_1)
< \frac{\lambda^1_P - m(0)U_P - r(0)(x_p + \delta V_P(\mu_2))}
 {U_P[ m(1) - m(0) ]+ x_P [r(1) -r(0)] 
 + \delta (r(1)V_P'(\mu_2) - r(0)V_P(\mu_2))}\\
a_2 = e & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) > \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
a_2 = w & \text{if } \mu_2(s_1, r) < \frac{\lambda^2_P - m(0)' U_P '}{m(1)' U_P' - m(0)' U_P'}\\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\mu^* = 
\begin{cases}
\mu_1(s_1) = p  & \text{in } \quad \text{round 1}\\
\mu_2(r, s_2) = 1 & \text{ if} \quad \omega_E = 1\\
\mu_2(r, s_2) = 0 & \text{ if} \quad \omega_E = 0\\
\end{cases}
$$

::: proof
The proof is largely sketched throughout the paper. First, note that @lem-wtoe shows $M$'s optimal strategy. Namely, always signal withdrawal in round 1 and then use separating strategies in round 2 based on type. $Ps$ optimal strategies and beliefs still stem from @lem-pbelief1, while the optimal behavior and beliefs for round 2 come from @prp-aligned2. However, to sustain such an equilibrium, the following conditions would need to hold:

If @eq-stratm_w_sep is to be an equilibrium strategy, then the following must be true for the parameters within the model:

First, $m(1)$ must satisfy the following conditions in round 2:

$$
m(1) > \frac{\lambda_M^2- \Delta m(1) U_M'}{U_M'}
$$

In round 1, the following must hold, which allows us to derive a more general condition:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M' m(1) + r(1)[\delta V_M'(\mu_2) + x_M] < \lambda_M^1\\
m(1) < \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(1)[\delta U_M' \Delta m(1) + \lambda_M^12 - c]}{U_M + r(1) \delta} \\
\frac{\lambda_M^2- \Delta m(1) U_M'}{U_M'} <  \frac{\lambda_M^1 - r(1)[\delta U_M' \Delta m(1) + \lambda_M^2 - c]}{U_M + r(1) \delta}\\
 0<\frac{\lambda_M^1- r(1)[\delta U_M' \Delta m(1)' +\lambda_M^2- c]}{U_M + r(1)' \delta} - \frac{\lambda_M^2}{U_M'} + \Delta m(1) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Recall that $\lambda_M^2 > \lambda_M^1$ and $U_M' > U_M$. $U_M'$ must take on the following conditions in round 2

The following must hold in round 1, which leads to a more general bound on $U_M$

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M' m(1) + r(1)[\delta U_M' m(1)' + x_M]) < \lambda_M^1\\
U_M' < \frac{\lambda_M^1 - U_M m(1) - r(1) x_M}{r(1) \delta m(1)'} \\
\frac{\lambda_M^2}{m(1)'} < \frac{\lambda_M^1- U_M m(1) - r(1) x_M}{r(1) \delta m(1)'} \\
0 < \lambda_M^1- U_M m(1) - r(1) x_M - \lambda_M^2r(1) \delta \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar to the previous equilibrium, since specific quantities of $\lambda_M^2$ are needed, it is helpful to see what the bounds are for it. In round 2, this amounts to the following:

$$
U_M' m(1)' >\lambda_M^2
$$

This leads to the following equation and manipulated expression in round 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
U_M m(0) + r(0)[\lambda_M^2 \delta + \lambda_M^2 - c] < \lambda_M^2\\
\lambda_M^2 < \frac{\lambda_M^1 - m(0)[\nu_M] + c[m(0) + r(0)]}{m(0) + r(0) \delta + r(0) }\\
U_M m(0) + r(0)[\lambda_M^2 \delta + \lambda_M^2- c] < \frac{\lambda_M^1 m(0)[\nu_M] + c[m(0) + r(0)]}{m(0) + r(0) \delta + r(0) } \\
0 < \lambda_M^1 - m(0)[\nu_M] + c[m(0) + r(0)] - [m(0) + r(0) \delta + r(0)] U_M m(0)
\end{aligned}
$$

This equilibrium also makes it easier to maintain when some parameters are lower. $\delta$ must obey the following inequality:

$$
\delta < \frac{\lambda_M^1- U_M m(\omega_E) - r(\omega_E) x_M}{r(\omega_E) V_M(\mu_2)}
$$

The lower any first-round probability is, the easier the equilibrium is to sustain:

$$
r(\omega_E) < \frac{\lambda_M^1- U_M m(\omega_E)}{\delta V_M(\mu_2) + x_M}
$$

$$
m(\omega_E) <  \frac{\lambda_M^1- r(\omega_E)[V_M(\mu_2) \delta + x_M])}{U_M}
$$

However, in the second stage, the change in the probability when facing the weak type drives this equilibrium strategy; hence, the second escalation probability when facing the weak type has to hold to the following structure, and the equilibrium is always easier to sustain the greater it is:

$$
m(1)' > \frac{\lambda_M^2}{U_M'}
$$

Moreover, the lower the stage payoff, the more likely this is to hold

$$
x_M < \frac{U_M m(\omega_E) - r(\omega_E) \delta}{r(\omega_E)}
$$
